"Golden Globes: Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, Angela Bassett will present awards. Here‚Äôs what to know","Barbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes ‚Äî they split the top film winners into two categories.","Michelle Yeoh, Will Ferrell, Angela Bassett and Amanda Seyfried will be among the presenters at Sunday‚Äôs Golden Globe Awards. The show announced its first batch of presenters on Wednesday.
Others taking the stage will be Julia Garner, George Lopez and Justin Hartley. Yeoh is returning to the Globes a year after she won best actress in a drama film for Everything Everywhere All at Once, delivering a poignant acceptance speech (and a semi-serious threat to beat up the piano player who started to cut her off).
Check out | Golden Globes 2024 nominations: The complete list
Wednesday‚Äôs announcement is the latest indicator that stars are likely to return to the show as it continues to attempt a return to form after several scandal-tarnished years. The show is known for its boozy celebration of film and television and as an early stop for awards season contenders. Scandals have led to a membership revamp and a new broadcaster for the Jan 7 show, but a key question remains: Will viewers tune in? Here‚Äôs more to know about the 81st Golden Globe Awards.
ADVERTISEMENT
How can I watch the Golden Globes?
Viewers in the United States can catch the ceremony, broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. It will air beginning at 5 p.m. on the West Coast. The three-hour show will have a strong lead-in since CBS is airing an NFL game directly before the Globes. CBS says the show will air on its app and stream on Paramount+, but there‚Äôs an important caveat. Only Paramount+ subscribers with the Showtime add-on will be able to watch the show live. Otherwise, it‚Äôll be available on the streaming platform on Monday.

What‚Äôs new with the Golden Globes?
The 81st Golden Globe Awards will be the first major broadcast of the awards season, with a new home on CBS. And while to audiences it might look similar on the surface, it‚Äôs been a tumultuous few years behind the scenes following a bombshell report in the Los Angeles Times. The 2021 report found that there were no Black members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which voted on the awards. Stars and studios boycotted the Globes and NBC refused to air it in 2022 as a result. After the group added journalists of colour to its ranks and instituted other reforms to address ethical concerns, the show came back in January 2023 in a one-year probationary agreement with NBC. The network did not opt to renew. In June, billionaire Todd Boehly was granted approval to dissolve the HFPA and reinvent the Golden Globes as a for-profit organization. Its assets were acquired by Boehly‚Äôs Eldridge Industries, along with Dick Clark Productions, a group that is owned by Penske Media whose assets also include Variety, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter, Rolling Stone and Billboard. The show has also added a new award for stand-up comedy, with Chris Rock, Amy Schumer and former Globes host Ricky Gervais among the nominees.
Who‚Äôs hosting the Globes?
Comedian Jo Koy, who has headlined several Netflix specials and starred in last year‚Äôs comedy film ‚ÄúEaster Sunday,‚Äù will host the Globes. Organizers cited his ‚Äúinfectious energy and relatable humour‚Äù in announcing Koy would headline the event. Hosting the Globes typically requires serving a mix of biting humour to the audience of film and television stars and keeping the ceremony from getting too sloppy. Previous hosts include Ricky Gervais, whose jokes were particularly caustic, the duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler and last year‚Äôs emcee, Jerrod Carmichael.

What about 60 Minutes?
The Globes, and New Year‚Äôs Eve celebrations, are keeping 60 Minutes from airing for two weeks. CBS aired New Year‚Äôs Eve Live: Nashville‚Äôs Big Bash on Sunday. CBS says 60 Minutes will resume on Jan. 14.
Golden Globe nominees
Barbie is the top nominee this year, followed closely by Oppenheimer. The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes ‚Äî they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig‚Äôs Barbie and Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Oppenheimer leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theatres in 2023. Films nominated for best motion picture drama include Oppenheimer, Martin Scorsese‚Äôs Killers of the Flower Moon, Bradley Cooper‚Äôs Maestro, Celine Song‚Äôs Past Lives, Justine Triet‚Äôs Anatomy of a Fall and Jonathan Glazer‚Äôs The Zone of Interest. In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, Barbie was joined by Ben Affleck‚Äôs Air, Cord Jefferson‚Äôs American Fiction, Alexander Payne‚Äôs The Holdovers, Todd Haynes‚Äô May December and Yorgos Lanthimos‚Äô Poor Things. Succession was the top-nominated television program, with nine nods including for series stars Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin, followed by Hulu‚Äôs The Bear.

What are the Globes known for?
The Golden Globe Awards had long been one of the highest-profile awards season broadcasts, second only to the Oscars. The show was touted as an A-list party whose hosts often took a more irreverent tone than their Academy counterparts. It also only honoured the flashiest filmmaking categories ‚Äî picture, director, and actors among them ‚Äî meaning no long speeches from visual effects supervisors or directors of little-known shorts. But the voting body was a small group of around 87 members who wielded incredible influence in the industry and often accepted lavish gifts and travel from studios and awards publicists eager to court favour and win votes.

‚Äî Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 4, 2024
Some years, the HFPA was pilloried for nominating poorly reviewed films with big-name talent in hopes of getting them to the show ‚Äî the most infamous being The Tourist, with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. In the past decade, they‚Äôve more often overlapped with the Oscars. The show also recognizes television. Before the expose and public relations crisis though, no one in the industry took much umbrage with who was voting on the awards. The show had become an important part of the Hollywood awards ecosystem, a platform for Oscar hopefuls and was, until recently, a reliable ratings draw. As of 2019, the broadcast was still pulling in nearly 19 million viewers. In 2023, NBC‚Äôs Tuesday night broadcast got its smallest audience ever for a traditional broadcast, with 6.3 million viewers.

Adani family‚Äôs partners used ‚Äòopaque‚Äô funds to invest in its stocks : Report,"Citing review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.","Millions of dollars were invested in some publicly traded stocks of India‚Äôs Adani Group via ‚Äúopaque‚Äù Mauritius funds that ‚Äúobscured‚Äù involvement of alleged business partners of the Adani family, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) said in an article on Thursday.
Citing review of files from multiple tax havens and internal Adani Group emails, nonprofit media organization OCCRP said its investigation found at least two cases where the investors bought and sold Adani stock through such offshore structures.
The OCCRP article comes after U.S.-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January accused Adani Group of improper business dealings, including the use of offshore entities in tax havens such as Mauritius from where it said certain offshore funds ‚Äúsurreptitiously‚Äù owned stock in Adani‚Äôs listed firms.
ADVERTISEMENT
Adani Group has called Hindenburg‚Äôs claims misleading and without evidence and said it always complied with laws. Days following the January report though, Adani group stocks lost $150 billion in market value and remain down around $100 billion following a recovery in recent months after it repaid some debt and regained some investor confidence.
In a statement to OCCRP, Adani Group said the Mauritius funds investigated by reporters had already been named in the Hindenburg report and the ‚Äúallegations are not only baseless and unsubstantiated but are rehashed from Hindenburg‚Äôs allegations.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is categorically stated that all the Adani Group‚Äôs publicly listed entities are in compliance with all applicable laws including the regulation relating to public share holdings,‚Äù it told the OCCRP, according to the news article.
Reuters has not independently verified OCCRP‚Äôs assertions. Adani Group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.
Hindenburg saga, regulatory probe 
ADVERTISEMENT
The Hindenburg report hit hard Gautam Adani, the billionaire who leads the ports-to-energy conglomerate and was until January the world‚Äôs third-richest person. The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.
India‚Äôs Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far ‚Äúdrawn a blank‚Äù in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.
Last week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator ‚Äúshall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,‚Äù it said. The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.

The OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article ‚Äì Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling ‚Äì described by OCCRP as ‚Äúlongtime business partners‚Äù of the Adani family.
Explained | SEBI seeks more time on Adani-Hindenburg report: The case so far
The media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli‚Äôs money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents ‚Äì including an agreement, corporate records and an email ‚Äì showed there ‚Äúis evidence‚Äù that their trading in Adani stock ‚Äúwas coordinated with the family.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani ‚Äòpromoters,‚Äô a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,‚Äù OCCRP said.

If so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership. Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP‚Äôs requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.
In an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, ‚ÄúWe are a simple business.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/adani-familys-partners-opaque-funds-invest-stocks-media-group-8917136/,business

"India vs Australia: After Ravindra Jadeja, Rohit Sharma ensures India seizes control of Nagpur Test on Day 1","IND vs AUS: On a slow turner, spinners shut Australia to 177 as skipper leads hosts strong reply","Just after Rohit Sharma clumped Nathan Lyon over mid-wicket, the off-spinner stared suspiciously at the surface. The pitch might have stared back inexpressively at him. Lyon had beaten him three balls ago, some balls before that were scudding low as well, but the 22-yard patch of intrigue and interest seemed to be more benign when Sharma rampaged to an unbeaten 56 off 69 balls, taking India to 77/1 at stumps, exactly a century of runs behind Australia‚Äôs total.
Perhaps, this was a case of batsman‚Äôs skills providing the pitch a harmless makeover. Perhaps, Australia‚Äôs batsmen made it look harder than it actually was. Perhaps, Sharma‚Äôs cavalier approach was the way to bat on this low-bounce, slow-turning deck. Maybe, Australia were a fraction overcautious in phases in the first session. Maybe, India‚Äôs spinners simply bowled better, tighter and sharper, though without any doubt this was a challenging surface to bat.

"Inflows in Gold ETF hit 16-month high at Rs 1,028 crore in August","Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted Rs 1,028 crore in August, making it the highest inflow in 16 months, amid continued hikes in interest rates in the US, which led to a slowing down in growth rate there.","Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted Rs 1,028 crore in August, making it the highest inflow in 16 months, amid continued hikes in interest rates in the US, which led to a slowing down in growth rate there.
With this, the year-to-date inflow in the category has reached more than Rs 1,400 crore, data with the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) showed.
Apart from inflow, the asset base of Gold ETFs and investors‚Äô account or folio numbers increased in the period under review.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to data, gold-linked ETFs have seen an inflow of Rs 1,028 crore in August. This came following an inflow of Rs 456 crore in the segment in July.
Before that, Gold ETF saw inflow to the tune of Rs 298 crore during the April-June period after three quarters of consecutive outflow. The category saw a withdrawal of Rs 1,243 crore in the March quarter, Rs 320 crore in the December quarter, and Rs 165 crore in the September quarter.
The month of August witnessed the highest monthly inflow into Gold ETFs since April 2022 when the category attracted Rs 1,100 crore on the back of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Flows into Gold ETFs have been subdued since then as the US Federal Reserve embarked on its tightening cycle.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúAs the end to the Fed‚Äôs tightening cycle is now coming close, prospects for gold are looking good. The metal has held its ground despite US yields and the US dollar being on an upward trajectory lately. A potential US recession, central bank gold buying, geopolitical tensions, rising US debt levels are all supporting interest in the precious metal,‚Äù Ghazal Jain, Fund Manager ‚Äì Alternative Investments at Quantum Mutual Fund, said.
Moreover, gold prices in recent times have come off from its all-time high levels, thereby providing some buying opportunity, particularly after a sharp rally it witnessed since March this year, Melvyn Santarita, Analyst ‚Äì Manager Research at Morningstar India, said.
‚ÄúWith the continued hike in interest rates in the US, inflation still higher than expectations, and growth rate slowing down, the appeal of gold as a safe haven and hedge against inflation is expected to continue,‚Äù Santarita added.

Gold, with its superlative performance over the last few years, has attracted significant investor interest and the consistent surge in its folio numbers is a testimony of the same.
Investor accounts in Gold ETFs climbed by 20,500 folios to 47.95 lakh in August from 47.75 lakh in the preceding month. This shows that investors have become more inclined toward gold-related funds.
Further, the assets under management of Gold ETFs surged by over 4 per cent to Rs 24,318 crore in August from Rs 23,330 crore in the preceding month.
Gold ETFs, which track the domestic physical gold price, are passive investment instruments that are based on gold prices and invest in gold bullion. In short, Gold ETFs are units representing physical gold which may be in paper or dematerialised form.
One Gold ETF unit is equal to 1 gram of gold and is backed by physical gold of very high purity. They combine the flexibility of stock investments and the simplicity of gold investments.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/gold-etf-inflows-hit-16-month-high-august-8945239/,business

Meta to include video live-streaming on next-gen Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses: Report,The reports also suggest that the device will come with enhanced cameras and viewers of the live-stream can also talk with the user.,"It‚Äôs a race of wearables, and Meta is leaving no stone unturned. After a report surfaced claiming that around 90 per cent of consumers abandoned the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, Meta seems to be bracing for a grand comeback. Unaffected by the existing model‚Äôs low user retention, Meta now has plans to let users livestream videos with viewers who can also interact with them.
A report by journalist Janko Roettgers, who is privy to internal documents, suggests that the latest iteration of Ray-Ban Stories will not only let users live-stream videos directly to Facebook and Instagram but will also allow viewers to talk back through the built-in headphones. While this may seem far-fetched, considering multiple viewers speaking at a time, Meta may have some unique ideas to execute this if true.

According to Roettgers, the new device will also feature improved battery life and enhanced cameras. The second-generation Ray-Ban Stories will also raise audio playback in case the surrounding sounds get too loud.
ADVERTISEMENT
The first-generation Ray-Ban Stories were introduced in September 2021. Facebook had unveiled the device that was expected to be its first-ever product to offer a glimpse of its plans for a metaverse. The smart glass was a collaboration between Meta Platforms and Italian optical equipment designer EssilorLuxottica. The sunglasses allow users to take pictures, listen to music, and send and receive WhatsApp and Facebook messages. The device came at a price of $299, along with various style combinations.

Reportedly, out of 300,000 units sold between September 2021 and February 2023, only 27,000 were still being regularly used. This was reportedly also an outcome of several technical problems, including issues with voice commands, audio, inadequate battery life, and difficulty in importing media from other devices. According to a report by the Journal, nearly 13 per cent of users had returned the product after purchase.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/meta-to-include-video-live-streaming-on-next-gen-ray-ban-stories-8910197/,technology

Vodafone agreed in 2022 to work with U.S. chipmaker Intel on the potential to design its own chip architecture.
The company‚Äôs director of network architecture Santiago Tenorio confirmed the partners would jointly create chipsets at its campus in Malaga, Spain.
The chipsets will be available to smaller third-party vendors to test their own algorithms without a large financial outlay in silicon, Tenorio said at the FYUZ industry event in Madrid.

He said the ability to produce silicon designs in testing sample quantities would significantly speed up the time to deliver innovation.

Amended norms for 28% GST on e-gaming kick in; companies raise concerns,Gaming federation writes missive to Finance Ministry,"Amended legal provisions and rules are set to kick in for online gaming, horse racing and casinos from Sunday (October 1), bringing into effect the 28 per cent tax at face value at entry level under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime and mandatory registration for offshore online gaming companies in India. Industry players and experts have, however, raised concerns about compliance and the applicability of the amended legal provisions as some states are still in the process of clearing the amendments for their respective State GST (SGST) laws.
On Saturday, in a letter written by All India Gaming Federation (AIGF) to Ministry of Finance, a copy of which has been seen by The Indian Express, online gaming companies have asked the government to reconsider the amendments, citing the fact that around 15 states are yet to make changes to their respective GST statutes.

"Why Enzo Fernandez‚Äôs British transfer-fee record is part soap opera, part circus and part reality show","The ripple effect would be dramatic. If Chelsea can splurge, Manchester City would feel they could splurge. Liverpool and Manchester United, with potential new owners six months from now, would not be far behind.","Less than six months after Manchester United turned down an offer from River Plate to sign the promising Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernandez for a reported fee of 20 million pound, a pittance by cash-fizzing Premier League standards, their rivals Chelsea acquired him for a head-spinning 107 million pounds, a British transfer fee record, which probably would be shattered in less than six months when the next window rolls up the shutters.
Between now and then, a lot has changed for Fernandez. Benfica signed him for nine million pounds, some genius in the Portuguese club had foreseen greatness twinkling on his toes that he inserted a 107 million pounds release clause in his contract, Fernandez dazzled in the World Cup with thunderous strikes, flowing passion and slick passing, won the tournament in his maiden appearance, hoarded applause from childhood hero Lionel Messi, and now finds himself as the most twinkling jewel in the collection of Chelsea‚Äôs new owner Todd Boehly. The American business man seems to be so driven by unbound commerce that his six months of spending could make his predecessor, the Ukraine oligarch Roman Abramovich blush. The club has forked out 600 million pounds since his takeover. Whoever claimed that American owners are spendthrifts, money-guzzling sharks!
As ridiculous as this sum seems for a player that shot to limelight just a month ago, with only 70 career league appearances, Fernandez‚Äôs was not a panic buy or a whim or fancy. Boehly has hired some of the finest players recruiters in Europe. Technical director of recruitment and talent Christopher Vivell and co-director have worked with Red Bull chain of clubs, the hottest talent producing factory in Europe. Part of the group are Lawrence Stewart, who has worked with Red Bull as well as Monaco, where he helped unearth the French midfield wizard Christopher Nkunku, the director of global Talent and transfers Paul Winstanley, who was the brain behind the emergence of relegation-scrapers Brighton as a competitive force. Surely, they might have pored over hundreds of footages, listened to as many inputs from scouts and technical staff of the teams he has played for or against before squeezing into the shop just before the windows were rolled down.
His purchase soared the gross spent of the January window, a phase when most teams are circumspect when spreeing, to a staggering 815 million pounds, double the previous records of 430 million pounds in 2018 and three-fold the amount in previous January window (¬£295m). Both windows combined, teams shelled out two million pounds, a runaway record. The heights of ambition of clubs are getting higher by the year, foolproof to the fickleness of global recession, mounting inflation and post-lockdown austerity. But more than the money, what baffles is the drama that unfolds during the transfer window, more dramatic than the battle for the league title, which has been one-sided for several years.
The deadline-day is an entity in itself, when negotiators spend endless hours brokering a deal, when scribes keep buzzing their sources for the information-nudge, when fans wait eagerly for updates on Twitter handles and news websites. Then the last hour u-turning of plans, last-minute coups, last-second meltdowns, teams playing hardball, agents acting pricey on the bargaining table, and suitors acting pricier. So much so that it could be as dramatic as the World Cup final in Qatar. Then the hurried medicals, rushed unveiling, as though all of these were a deliberate, broader plan to kill mid-league slumber.
Chelsea‚Äôs Enzo Fernandez reacts. (AP Photo)
The Fernandez saga that raged on for most of January is a textbook case. Chelsea had expressed their interest as soon as the 22-year-old was adjudged the best young player of the World Cup. So were other clubs, only to be dissuaded by the hefty release clause that Benfica were adamant on meeting. Chelsea attempted a backdoor barge-in, by making the player agree personal terms and thus force the club into selling him. Only for the club to cash in on Chelsea‚Äôs indiscretion, and publicly denigrate them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disrespectful against all of us,‚Äù manager Roger Schmidt would say. ‚ÄúSo to make the player crazy and then pretend they can pay the clause and later they want to negotiate, I think it‚Äôs not what I understand about a good relationship between clubs who maybe want to discuss a player,‚Äù he lashed at Chelsea‚Äôs negotiating tactics.
Chelsea‚Äôs Enzo Fernandez controls the ball. (AP Photo)
Then one day, Fernandez stopped coming for practice. When the deal seemed hitting a rough road, he resumed training, made a couple of appearances and even managed to score a goal. Then there are the tales of the transfers that did not happen for the most bizarre reasons. Like Zimbabwean international Benjani Mwaruwari could not attend the medicals in time for a move to Manchester City because he missed a flight because he had fallen asleep. Another story goes that Turkish agent Dr. Erkut Sogut was forced to sort out a transfer from hospital while his wife was giving birth. ‚ÄúMy second son is born and I have this photo where they have given me my newborn baby and I‚Äôm holding him while still on the phone ‚Äì I don‚Äôt even look at my son, all the interest is in finishing this deal. Finally one hour later it was finished ‚Äì it was the craziest day of my life,‚Äù he recollected to Daily Mirror.

What did Ramiz Raja say about Shubman Gill‚Äôs batting,Raja also spoke about how India continued to dominate teams at home and that this enviable record needed to be replicated by Pakistan if they wanted to become a better cricketing side.,"India sealed their third straight bilateral series in a row when they won the second ODI against New Zealand in Raipur behind a scintillating bowling performance that saw the Kiwis collapse for 108. India then chased down the target with ease and former Pakistan Cricket Board boss Ramiz Raja went on his Youtube channel to praise the Indian performance.
He particularly singled out Shubman Gill for his performances. Gill slammed a double hundred in the first ODI and was compared to the Indian captain Rohit Sharma, by Raja.
‚ÄúShubman Gill looks like a mini-Rohit Sharma. He has extra time and looks good. He has enough potential. Aggression will also develop with time. He doesn‚Äôt need to change anything. He scored a double hundred recently,‚Äù said Raja.
‚ÄúBatting was easy for India because they have an outstanding batter like Rohit Sharma. He plays exceedingly well. He is an amazing striker of hook-and-pull shots, so a 108-run chase becomes easy,‚Äù Raja added.
The former Pakistan player then spoke about India‚Äôs bowling and how effective they were in their role in Raipur. Raja added that the Indian bowling unit turned the game on New Zealand‚Äôs head by doing the things the Kiwis are known to do best.

Hailing Rohit‚Äôs captaincy after India retained the Boder-Gavaskar Trophy with a six-wicket win over Australia in the second Test here on Sunday, Dravid said the Mumbaikar has the respect of the dressing room.
‚ÄúHe is one of those guys who has been there a long time. The kind of person who doesn‚Äôt speak a lot, but when he does they all listen.
‚ÄúHe deeply cares a lot about the dressing room and the players. We are very lucky to have Rohit take over the leadership from someone like Virat,‚Äù Dravid said after the match.
Skipper Rohit hailed the spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin for ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù the job for India.
Jadeja returned with a career-best 7/42 and, along with Ravichandran Ashwin (3/59), accounted for all the wickets to bundle out Australia for a paltry 113 in their second innings.

‚ÄúLooking at how things were yesterday, the way we came back and finished our job was great,‚Äù Rohit said at the post-match presentation.
‚ÄúEven if we were just one run behind, I felt we were trailing because we had to bat last.
‚ÄúThe bowlers were fantastic, to take nine wickets today morning is commendable. And then we finished the job with the bat.‚Äù From being overnight 61/1, Australia were bundled out in the first session of the third day.
‚ÄúEvery game you play in this type of weather, there is some moisture. What I noticed is there is a lot to offer in the first session, but as it goes on it gets slower and there isn‚Äôt enough bite.
‚ÄúSo our focus was keeping it tight in the morning, and these guys are the masters of bowling in these conditions.

‚ÄúOn a pitch like this, people need to do something different. We were prepared for them coming out and playing shots.
‚ÄúOur idea was to not panic and just hit the right areas, waiting for the mistake to happen and that‚Äôs exactly what happened.‚Äù Rohit said the partnerships between Jadeja-Virat Kohli and Axar Patel-Ashwin gave them the winning edge.
‚ÄúThere are lot of moments across four innings, but I thought the partnership between Jadeja and Virat, and then Axar-Ash was brilliant.
That‚Äôs a big help because of the balance we have created for ourselves.‚Äù Dravid said: ‚ÄúWe wanted to chase something close to 200-225 and that partnership enabled us to get back, or we‚Äôd have been trailing.‚Äù Dravid further said their bowlers leaked too many runs in the final session of day two and credited them for coming back in the first session on Sunday.

Rather, it prioritises improving existing functions and oiling up stuff under the hood so that everything runs smoother than before. Let‚Äôs take a look.
Android 14 top features
Lock screen customisation
Android users have long appreciated the ability to personalise their home screens, but with Android 14, the customisation game has reached a new level.

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äì Android 14 also lets users create parallax effect wallpapers from their own photos, craft cartoon-style wallpapers with their favourite emojis, and even generate AI-powered wallpapers based on text prompts.

"Council to discuss tax rate for online gaming, GST on multiplex food and drinks",The finance ministry in its Annual Economic Review for 2022-23 noted that the higher annual growth in FY23 was driven mainly by better-than-expected growth in the January-March quarter.,"High import prices and elevated import demand amid weak external demand have resulted in negative net exports in real terms that have shown a sharp downward trajectory and prevented India‚Äôs real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth from crossing the pre-pandemic trend trajectory, the finance ministry said in its Annual Economic Review for 2022-23, on Thursday.
Volatility in global financial systems, sharp price correction in global stock markets, high magnitude of El-Nino impact, and modest trade activity and FDI inflows owing to frail global demand are factors that can constrain the pace of growth going ahead, it added.

OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro review: Let some class weigh in,"The first aspect you will notice about the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro is its weight. At close to 2 kg, this is by far the heaviest computer accessory I have used.","There is something about mechanical keyboards that makes them both nostalgic and functional. Let me tell you I am old enough to have learnt typing on a Remington typewriter, long before computers and keyboards became a thing in India. And those spaced-out keys of the old typewriter, packing a kick every time you hit a key, is exactly what I am reminded of whenever I test a mechanical keyboard. And this feeling just went to another level with the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro.
When the review unit came in via courier, I thought they had sent me the wrong package. The box was so heavy that my son struggled to bring it up from the lobby. It was only when I unwrapped it that I was convinced that this was indeed the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro.

The Tata Group company had reported a net profit of Rs 9,478 crore in the year-ago period and Rs 11,392 crore in the preceding quarter.
Its revenue from operations increased 12.55 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 59,381 crore and was marginally up from the preceding March quarter‚Äôs Rs 59,162 crore.

TCS is the first major company to report its June quarter results.
It can be noted that with headwinds in its key markets, the USD 250 billion Indian IT sector is widely expected to report volatility in the near term.
In a statement, the company said its order book now stands at USD 10.2 billion and termed it a ‚Äúrobust‚Äù one.
Its newly appointed chief executive and managing director K Krithivasan said, ‚ÄúWe remain confident in the longer-term demand for our services, driven by the emergence of newer technologies‚Äù.

The company‚Äôs operating profit margin increased marginally to 23.2 per cent from 23.1 per cent a year ago.
Its chief financial officer Samir Seksaria said operating profit margin at 23.2 per cent number includes a 2 percentage points impact of the annual wage hike for employees.
TCS added 523 employees on a net basis to take its overall headcount to over 6.15 lakh as of June 30, 2023. The attrition rate was 17.8 per cent.

Its chief of human resources Milind Lakkad said it has given a wage hike of 12-15 per cent to exceptional performers.
From a segmental perspective, growth was led by clients in the life sciences and healthcare sector at 10.1 per cent, while its mainstay of banking, financial services and insurance grew only 3 per cent.
Among the geographies, the United Kingdom led with a 16.1 per cent revenue growth, while North America grew at 4.6 per cent.
It can be noted that North America and BFSI ‚Äì which constitute the biggest revenue pie for the sector ‚Äì are the most affected in the current scenario, wherein some banks have gone down in the US due to asset-liability mismatches amid interest rate hikes to tame the runaway inflation by the Federal Reserve.

Pig‚Äôs head delivered to Serie A‚Äôs beleaguered Sampdoria,"Last month, a blank bullet was delivered to Sampdoria's offices accompanied by threats against Ferrero and Edoardo Garrone, a previous owner of the club.","Italian Serie A strugglers Sampdoria received a sinister warning from an unknown source on Saturday when a severed pig‚Äôs head was delivered to the club‚Äôs headquarters.
The ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù-style gift was found in a box along with a message addressed to former club president Massimo Ferrero and current vice-president Antonio Romei reading ‚Äúthe next heads will be yours‚Äù, a spokesman for the club said.

Last month, a blank bullet was delivered to Sampdoria‚Äôs offices accompanied by threats against Ferrero and Edoardo Garrone, a previous owner of the club.
Ferrero, who still controls Sampdoria via a family holding, resigned from his position after he was arrested in 2021 on financial charges unrelated to football. The 71-year-old has angered fans who say he is running down Sampdoria‚Äôs finances and refusing to sell the club to new owners capable of rescuing it from financial and sporting disaster.
The Genoa-based side currently sit second-bottom of the table on 11 points after 23 games, eight points adrift of safety, and are critically short of cash.

Cambridge University launches first-ever visiting fellowship to study Indian indentured labour history,"Gaiutra Bahadur is the author of ‚ÄòCoolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture', a major study of the lives of Indian women who became indentured labourers to colonial plantations in the 19th century.","The University of Cambridge has created what is believed to be the first-ever visiting fellowship into the study of indentured labour, the controversial system involving millions of Indians that replaced slavery during British colonisation.
The university‚Äôs Selwyn College appointed Guyanese-American Professor Gaiutra Bahadur last week as the ‚ÄúRamesh and Leela Narain visiting bye-fellow in Indentureship Studies‚Äù.
Bahadur is the author of ‚ÄòCoolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture‚Äô, a major study of the lives of Indian women who became indentured labourers to colonial plantations in the 19th century.
Read | ‚ÄòWe are sorry to inform you‚Ä¶‚Äô: Indian students in UK struggle to find jobs after spending lakhs on ‚Äòrip-off‚Äô degrees
‚ÄúI am honoured and delighted to be the inaugural visiting bye-fellow in indentureship studies,‚Äù said Bahadur.
‚ÄúWhen I first began doing research in this area, the funding just wasn‚Äôt there, so it was in many ways a labour of love. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so happy to see there‚Äôs now visibility and funding like this to help future researchers,‚Äù she said.
Selwyn College and the Ameena Gafoor Institute, which studies indentureship and its legacy, collaborated closely in setting up the programme which allows a scholar to spend eight weeks at the university to conduct their research.
The programme will run for an initial five years.
‚ÄúThe study and documentation of indentureship is undoubtedly valuable, but it has barely been included in the history syllabi of British and European Universities ‚Äì a staggering omission considering the millions of individuals, and indeed entire cultures, irrevocably shaped by indentureship and its legacies,‚Äù said Professor David Dabydeen, the Guyanese novelist, poet and academic who is the director of the Ameena Gafoor Institute.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThat is why this fellowship, and hopefully eventually establishing a Professorship, is so important. Cambridge has created an academic subject, bringing it from the margins to the very centre. I am immensely grateful to the Gafoor family in Guyana for helping to make all this possible,‚Äù he said.
According to the institute, in relation to the British colonial period and Empire, the largest and most concerted expression of indenture ‚Äì a temporary contract between employer and labourer ‚Äì occurred between 1834 and 1920, when 2 million Indians, and thousands of others from across Asia, Africa, and Oceania were exploited under a system intended to replace enslaved African labour in the Caribbean and Mauritius.
‚ÄúOften recruited with false promises and misinformation, workers had little recourse to justice from a colonial project that was entirely dependent on their labour for its capital. Wherever it has occurred, indenture has almost universally included forms of abuse and exploitation,‚Äù it notes.
The study of indentureship and its legacies was one of the recommendations made in a university report on the ‚ÄòLegacies of Enslavement‚Äô by Cambridge Advisory Group. The university said it is hoped that enough funding will eventually be raised to establish a permanent Professorship in the subject, based at Cambridge.

Belkin BoostCharge Pro power bank and wall charger review: Convenience on the go,I just got back from Mumbai with the Belkin BoostCharge Pro power bank and wall charger. Traveling light and staying charged has never been easier.,"I just returned from a one-day trip to Mumbai which left me wondering I travel with so many gadgets, most of which I never end up using. This also means there is always a mess of wires and chargers that I have to take along and this is just another hassle at airport security. Apple has made my life easier this year by moving the iPhone 15 to USB-C, which means I just need two different cables to get my work done ‚Äî the Apple Watch charger and a USC-C cable for the iPhone and MacBook. Belkin just made my life a bit more easier.
This trip, I carried with me the new Belkin BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for the Apple Watch which also doubled up as a 10,000 mAh power bank for the iPhone and other gadgets. For a one-day trip, you usually don‚Äôt need a charger if you like me use the Apple Watch Ultra as it lasts almost two days on a single charge and you can always go to low power mode to make it last longer.
The charger itself is handy and not like a brick. (Image: Nandagopal Rajan/The Indian Express)
But this time the compact power bank was in the bag, just in case I ran out of charge. The charger itself is handy and not like a brick, given that it has a large battery inside. It has a soft rubbery finish which ensures it does not scratch easily, though inside a bag all the dust and lint does end up sticking to this surface. On one end of the power bank is the white circle that you can use for charging the Apple Watch.
ADVERTISEMENT
I used it for an overnight charge, wrapping the Apple Watch Ultra around the power bank which is quite easy to do given its size. By morning it was fully charged, even though it was only down to 60% after the first day. Since the Watch can be strapped around the charger, it is easy to charge on the move too as you can keep it in the back with the watch still attached.
After a day of meetings, I was rushing to the Mumbai airport to be on time for another meeting, which I did not want to attend on the road. As I was down to 50% and had a flight to take soon after, I plugged in the iPhone 15 Pro Max to the charger using the small USB-C cable that comes in the box. After a 30-minute Zoom call at a plush airport restaurant, I was pleased to see the phone back at full charge. On the power bank, there is a small button that lights up LEDs that show the battery level. Again a very handy feature. I saw the LED was down by one unit after the phone was charged. The power bank can charge your watch up to 14 times and the iPhone twice when it has full juice.

At Rs 10,999, the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for the Apple Watch is not very budget-friendly. But a user with multiple Apple devices would probably not care about the price.

Belkin BoostCharge Pro 140W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger
What if on your trips you had just one wall charger that could take care of all your devices? Well, that is exactly what the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 140W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger does. This handy gadget offers you multiple charging options, ranging from 20W to 140W.
ADVERTISEMENT
It has three PD 3.1 fast-charging USB-C outlets to take care of everything from the Apple Watch to the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. There is also a USB-A 140W charger below this. A small button on top releases the India pin and reveals the US pin in case you are travelling. But yes, the wall charger is a bit on the larger side given the range of stuff it has to do, and a bit heavy as well. But then this is also the only charger you will need to carry with you.

Often on my trips to the US, I carry multiple chargers as well as power strips as I don‚Äôt have multiple converters with me for the devices. I usually use the converter just on the power strip and charge all my devices on it. Now with a wall charger like this, I just need to carry this one unit for all my devices. Yes, I do travel with a range of devices that will need all these ports. With this one, I just need three USB-C cables to juice up the Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad at the same time as the USB-A powers the MacBook.
As I am reviewing the new M3 MacBook Pro, I used the charger to juice it back up to about 60 per cent in just about 40 minutes in the morning. Just enough for me to work the entire weekend given how good the battery is now on the M3 devices. The iPhone 15 Pro Max can be charged to full in about 40 minutes.
At Rs 13,999, the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 140W 4-Port GaN Wall Charger is also for those who are ready to splurge for convenience. This is a great option for those always on the move with multiple devices.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/belkin-boostcharge-pro-power-bank-and-wall-charger-review-9041793/,technology

Other prominent features of the OnePlus Open are said to be a 7.8-inch primary foldable screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and, a secondary 6.3-inch cover display with up to 120Hz refresh rate. Unlike Samsung‚Äôs foldable, the OnePlus Open is unlikely to offer any sort of water resistance rating.

TCS cracks whip against 6 staffers in bribery case,The increase in Europe's largest economy comes a day before the release of inflation figures for the entire 20-country area that uses the euro currency.,"Inflation is pushing in different directions in Europe, rising in Germany and falling again in Spain, official figures said Thursday.
German consumer prices jumped 6.8 per cent in June from a year earlier, up from May‚Äôs 6.3 per cent, the state statistics office Destatis said. The figure was boosted in part by a widely used offer of cheap transport tickets last summer, analysts said.
The increase in Europe‚Äôs largest economy comes a day before the release of inflation figures for the entire 20-country area that uses the euro currency. Inflation in the eurozone has been falling from its peak of 10.6 per cent in October, coming in at 6.1 per cent in May.

But that is still far above the target of 2 per cent set by the European Central Bank. ECB chief Christine Lagarde has warned inflation is persistent enough to warrant at least one more interest rate hike at the bank‚Äôs July 27 meeting.
Higher interest rates are central banks‚Äô chief tool against inflation.
Meanwhile, lower food and energy inflation meant Spain‚Äôs consumer price index increased only 1.6 per cent in June from a year earlier, down from 2.9 per cent in May.
Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the low Spanish rate was unlikely to influence ECB decision-making ‚Äúas country-specific factors are taking Spanish inflation much lower than in other countries.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/inflation-moving-different-directions-europe-6-8-germany-1-6-in-spain-8692967/,business

Benq V5000i Laser TV projector review: The mighty screen,"With ambitions to replace high-end televisions, the Benq V5000i runs the Android TV software with inbuilt Dolby Atmos audio technology.","The debate over whether a projector can replace a television was settled long back. Now, the question is how much better an experience a projector offers in the home compared to a television. And that is the question top-end Laser TV Projectors like the Benq V5000i want to address.
When I signed up for the Benq V5000i review, little did I know what I was getting into. I don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way. It is just that the Benq V5000i is a large projector, as large as projectors can be. It can be used with a 100-inch BenQ ALR Screen that ensures you have the best experience while using this projector. This means the projector is not fit for small homes like mine. But if you have a dedicated space that can be converted into a home theatre then this Benq projector should be in your reckoning.

Rupee falls 9 paise to close at 83.19 against US dollar,"Forex traders said that positive sentiment in the stock market, a weak greenback against major currencies overseas and steady crude oil prices restricted losses in the local currency.","The rupee declined by 9 paise to settle at 83.19 (provisional) against the US dollar on Tuesday due to dollar buying by importers amid lingering worries over oil supplies through the Red Sea route.
Forex traders said that positive sentiment in the stock market, a weak greenback against major currencies overseas and steady crude oil prices restricted losses in the local currency.
At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened flat at 83.10 against the greenback and traded between the peak of 83.09 and the lowest level of 83.22. It finally settled at 83.19, registering a loss of 9 paise over its previous close.

The rupee breached the 82 level twice this week to touch a high of 82.90.

US curbs AI chip exports from Nvidia and AMD to some Middle East countries,U.S. officials usually impose export controls for national security reasons.,"The U.S. expanded the restriction of exports of sophisticated Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices artificial-intelligence chips beyond China to other regions including some countries in the Middle East.
Nvidia said in a regulatory filing this week that the curbs, which affect its A100 and H100 chips designed to speed up machine-learning tasks, would not have an ‚Äúimmediate material impact‚Äù on its results.
Rival AMD also received an informed letter with similar restrictions, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding that the move has no material impact on its revenue.

U.S. officials usually impose export controls for national security reasons. A similar move announced last year signaled an escalation of the U.S. crackdown on China‚Äôs technological capabilities, but it was not immediately clear what risks were posed by exports to the Middle East.
In a separate statement, Nvidia said the new licensing requirement ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt affect a meaningful portion of our revenue. We are working with the U.S. government to address this matter.‚Äù

The U.S. Commerce Department, which normally administers new licensing requirements on exports, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Last September AMD said it had received new license requirements that would halt exports of its MI250 artificial-intelligence chips to China.
ADVERTISEMENT
Nvidia, AMD and Intel have since then all disclosed plans to create less powerful AI chips that can be exported to the Chinese market.
Nvidia, which gave no reason for the new restrictions in the filing dated Aug. 28, last year said U.S. officials informed them the rule ‚Äúwill address the risk that products may be used in, or diverted to, a ‚Äòmilitary end use‚Äô or ‚Äòmilitary end user‚Äô in China.‚Äù
Nvidia this week did not specify which countries in the Middle East were affected. The company derived most of its $13.5 billion in sales in its fiscal quarter ended July 30 from the United States, China and Taiwan. About 13.9% of sales came from all other countries combined, and Nvidia does not provide a revenue breakout from the Middle East.
‚ÄúDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG (U.S. government) informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East,‚Äù Nvidia said in the Aug. 28 filing.

Last year‚Äôs announcements came as tensions bubbled over the fate of Taiwan, where chips for Nvidia and almost every other major chip firm are manufactured.

In October 2022, the Biden administration went a step further when it published a sweeping set of export controls, including a measure to cut off China from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with U.S. equipment. The move vastly expanded Washington‚Äôs reach in its bid to slow Beijing‚Äôs technological and military advances.
Japan and the Netherlands followed up with similar rules earlier this year.
Without American AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD, Chinese organizations will be unable to cost-effectively carry out the kind of advanced computing used for image and speech recognition, among many other tasks.

"Avoid dressing room banter bordering on bullying, racial harassment: Strauss","The Pakistan-born cricketer, who played for county side Yorkshire for almost a decade, had told UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) in November 2021 that racist comments and actions by fellow cricketers had left him ""close to taking his own life"".","Former England captain Andrew Strauss has urged cricketers to avoid dressing room banter bordering on racial harassment and bullying in order to avert controversies like the Azeem Rafiq fiasco.
The Pakistan-born cricketer, who played for county side Yorkshire for almost a decade, had told UK‚Äôs Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) in November 2021 that racist comments and actions by fellow cricketers had left him ‚Äúclose to taking his own life‚Äù.
Strauss, the former England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) director of cricket, said during his Marylebone Cricket Club Cowdrey Lecture at Lord‚Äôs on Wednesday that with players of different nationalities and races now sharing dressing rooms more than ever, cricketers will have to be more guarded in what they say and do.
‚ÄúAs we move forward together as a game with players of different genders, races, creeds and beliefs coming together, so the traditional macho, hierarchical, perhaps at times verging on bullying dressing-room banter will need to be softened to a culture that is more tolerant, understanding, welcoming and embracing of difference,‚Äù Strauss, one of the most successful England captains, was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.
Strauss also highlighted the significance of the spirit of cricket, saying the events of the last year-and-a-half ‚Äî when the Azeem Rafiq scandal unfolded and tarnished the image of England cricket ‚Äî had shown a lot more needed to be done to restore the image of the game.
‚ÄúPerhaps more importantly the spirit of cricket needs to accompany modern players and I am speaking primarily about the men‚Äôs game now into an area that neither the prying eyes of the media or the feverish adulation of the fans penetrates; the dressing room,‚Äù Strauss said.
‚ÄúThe events over the last 18 months, whether they come from Yorkshire or elsewhere have shown we have a lot of work to do in this area, but the spirit of cricket demands this.‚Äù With England winning nine of the 10 Tests under coach Brendon McCullum and skipper Ben Stokes, Strauss said the coming together of the duo had brought about a huge tactical shift in the way the longest format is being played now.
ADVERTISEMENT
England‚Äôs run of victories in Tests against India, New Zealand, South Africa and Pakistan last year saw them erase the disappointment of having won just one in 17 games before the pair was appointed.
‚ÄúThe coming together of Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes in May last year has shifted the game of Test cricket from its foundations and has asked some fundamental questions of the centuries-old accepted truths of the Test format,‚Äù said Strauss.
‚ÄúWhat those two extraordinary leaders of men ‚Äî aided in no small part by Rob Key as director of cricket ‚Äî have done, is redefine once again what the game of cricket is actually about.‚Äù With a lot of talk about Test cricket losing its significance amid the onslaught of domestic T20 leagues across the world, Strauss indicated that the popularity of traditional rivalries like the Ashes and series between major Test-playing nations will never go out of fashion, though some debt-laden national governing bodies could be at a disadvantage.
‚ÄúIt is inevitable that some old institutions might creak at the seams, including some debt-laden national governing bodies and professional clubs,‚Äù said Strauss.

IND vs AUS : Ian Chappell calls Australian selections as ‚ÄòPanic selections‚Äô and overthinking selections,The Australian great was critical of the Australian selectors of the team combinations for the first two Test matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy,"Terming Australia‚Äôs selections in the first two Test matches of the Border-Gavaskar trophy as ‚ÄòPanic selections‚Äô, former Australian captain Ian Chappell has slammed Australia‚Äôs Test selectors on ‚Äòoverthinking‚Äô the line-up. With the Australian team management not picking up Travis Head for the first Test at Nagpur, Chappell was more critical of the bowling selections for the Delhi Test. The Australian team management had overlooked left-arm spinner Ashton Agar and had called another left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann ahead of the second Test at Delhi. The Pat Cummins-led Australian team lost the second Test by six wickets and is now trailing 0-2 in the four-Test match series.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there was any justification for some of the things they have done-their selections smacked of panic. If you want to look at panic, the dropping of Head (and) playing Renshaw saying he‚Äôs a good player of spin bowling, and you bat him in the middle order. You come in the second Test with one quick only, you fly Kuhnemann over from Australia and you play him ahead of Agar, who bowls the same sort of stuff, and was in the original squad. Now you are going to tell me they are not panic selections? This is the problem‚Ä¶ they overthink things,‚Äù said Chappell while speaking with Wide World of Sports.
With Australia suffering an innings and 132-run loss in Nagpur followed by a six-wicket loss in Delhi in the second Test of the series, the Pat Cummins team had been left looking for answers for the dismal performances. With only two Australian batsmen able to cross double figures in the second innings at Delhi, Chappell also blamed the team management for the batting selections as well picking up the right bowling options. With all-rounder Cameron Green still not fit for the series, the former Australian captain opined the team management don‚Äôt have any clue for the right bowling combination in India.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they know what their best bowling lineup is. I also don‚Äôt think they think what their best batting lineup is in India, but ‚Ä¶ the best batsmen are in India now. You‚Äôve got to pick your best bowlers. As the selector, you have to ask who do you think will take the 20 wickets the quickest. And I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve got a clue who that is, certainly not in India. In Australia, they know damn well-three quickies, Green as a fourth seamer, and one spinner, they‚Äôre fine here. But this is not Australia-It‚Äôs in India and you‚Äôve got to find a way to play well, and Australia haven‚Äôt found that method,‚Äù said Chappell.
While debutant Khunemann finished with match figures of 2 for 110 in Delhi, Chappell wasn‚Äôt impressed with the Australian spinner and supported Agar, who was picked in the original squad. ‚ÄúAgar must be bowling very badly if they pick him in the original squad, and they put this guy ahead of him.

Google DeepMind co-founder calls for US to enforce AI standards,The US has expanded restriction of exports of sophisticated Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices artificial-intelligence chips beyond China to other regions including some countries in the Middle East.,"The US should allow Nvidia‚Äôs artificial intelligence (AI) chips only to buyers who agree to ethically use the technology, Google DeepMind‚Äôs co-founder Mustafa Suleyman told the Financial Times on Friday.
The US should enforce minimum global standards for the use of AI, and companies should at a minimum agree to abide by the same pledge made by leading AI firms to the White House, Suleyman said.
In July, AI companies including OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta Platforms made voluntary commitments to the White House to implement measures such as watermarking AI-generated content to help make the technology safer.

Top ex-Google Brain researchers start AI research company in Tokyo,"Sakana AI, founded by David Ha and Llion Jones, declined to disclose funding details.","Two prominent former Google researchers, one of whom was a co-inventor of the ‚Äútransformer‚Äù artificial intelligence architecture that paved the way for the generative AI boom, announced on Thursday they had started a new AI company based in Tokyo.

Jones is the fifth author on Google‚Äôs 2017 research paper ‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù, which introduced the ‚Äútransformer‚Äù deep learning architecture that went on to become the basis for viral chatbot ChatGPT and the current race to develop products powered by generative AI.

‚ÄúRather than building one huge model that sucks all this data, our approach could be using a large number of smaller models, each with their own unique advantage and smaller data set, and having these models communicate and work with each other to solve a problem,‚Äù said Ha, though he clarified this was just an idea.

"With win over world number 2 Carlos Alcaraz, distance-running enthusiast Cameron Norrie shows he has gas in tank for the long haul",The South-Africa born 27-year-old Norrie won his fifth ATP Tour title in Rio Open on Sunday,"As a player at the Texas Christian University (TCU), British Tennis player Cameron Norrie once ran a 10km marathon post his training session. The 27-year-old, who has competed in marathon five-setters on the ATP Tour circuit in the past, got the better of world number two Carlos Alcaraz of Spain with a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 win in the final of the Rio Open in Argentina to claim his fifth ATP Tour title. Norrie, who had reached Wimbledon semi-finals last year, before his loss against Novak Djokovic, is known for his fitness drills in the tennis circuit and that‚Äôs what his coach Devin Bowen had recalled.
‚ÄúOn his day off, he loves to run. He loves long-distance running as a hobby. There was a 10K in town and he just went and he didn‚Äôt text, he just did it. He ran the 10K and won it. It was like, ‚ÄòYes, that‚Äôs great that you did that, but the whole point of today was to rest your body and we‚Äôre going to start up again.‚Äô So he won the Fort Worth 10k, and that was just on a day off. It kind of gives you an idea of what kind of animal you‚Äôre dealing with,‚Äù Devin Bowen, assistant coach at TCU had told ATP Tour in an interview earlier.

‚Äî Cameron Norrie (@cam_norrie) February 27, 2023
Born to a Scottish father and a Welsh mother in Johannesburg in South Africa, a young Norrie grew up in Auckland and also represented New Zealand at the junior level. According to his mother Helen as reported by The Guardian, the youngster‚Äôs first tennis racket was a refurbished squad racket and Norrie played with it at the age of six in their backyard in their home in Auckland. Norrie moved to London having pledging allegiance to Britain at the age of 16 and was chosen for a scholarship at the Texas Christian University supported by London Tennis Association.
He spent more than four years in the USA before turning professional in 2017. Within an year, Norrie won his first Davis Cup match with a win over the then world number 23 Roberto Bautista Agut with former British Davis Cup captain John Lloyd terming his debut as one of the most impressive debuts in Davis Cup. The year also saw him making his Wimbledon main draw debut, where he lost to Jo-Wifried Tsonga in the first round before he made a second round appearance in the US Open. Starting 2021 at a world ranking of 74th, Corrie had 52 single‚Äôs wins on the ATP Tour with two titles resulting in his rise to world number 12.

Norrie broke into the top-1 in world rankings last year with his fourth ATP Tour title in Lyon, France before he reached the Wimbledon semi-finals with a 3-6, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 win over David Goffin. Though he lost to eventual champion Djokovic in the semi-finals in a four-set match, Norrie termed the quarter-final win against Goffin as a crazy day. He would also cycle from his London home to Wimbledon courts during the tournament. ‚ÄúNot had too much time for it to sink in, but it was just a crazy day, and to do it in the way that I did in five sets, coming back from two-sets-to-one, I can‚Äôt really describe it. Just a lot of emotions, and a pretty sick match to get through. I‚Äôm just glad they (his parents) got to witness it and they definitely deserve a glass of wine each.‚Äù Norrie had told Sky Sports post the match.

Last December, Norrie scored a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over former world number one Rafael Nadal in a United Cup match. He had never won a set against Nadal in their four previous matches but his win gave Great Britain a 1-0 lead in the tie. Sunday‚Äôs title was Norrie‚Äôs fifth title on the ATP Tour and the 27-year-old won the match with an ace in the final set to win his second title on clay. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so special to win this one especially after losing a couple of finals already this year. I had to do it the tough way, I was a set and a break down and 0-30 on my serve. I managed to flick a switch and turn it around, so it was a good day.‚Äù Norrie said post the win.
The 27-year-old also plans to run marathons post his tennis career. On being asked about his love for running, he had shared his views on running marathons post his tennis career. ‚ÄúI would maybe like to after tennis. I quite enjoy running, but I haven‚Äôt been able to do that much. I feel like when I‚Äôm resting, I have to chill and relax rather than I think maybe three years ago my team were like, ‚ÄòAll right, rest‚Äô, and then I‚Äôll go the next day and run a little bit. I feel like now I‚Äôve been a bit better with that and not really going out and running too much. I‚Äôm able to kind of rest and maybe do something different, try to play golf or do something like that rather than go out and run.‚Äù Corrie had told ATP Tour earlier.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/from-running-10k-marathon-to-defeating-world-number-2-carlos-alcaraz-cameron-norrie-has-arrived-at-world-tennis-circuit-8468936/,sports

"Provide borrowers option to switch to fixed interest rates, RBI tells banks","RBI said that at the time of reset of interest rates, Regulated Entities (REs) should provide an option to borrowers to switch over to a fixed rate as per their board-approved policy.","The Reserve Bank on Friday asked banks and other lenders to provide individual borrowers an option of switching over to a fixed rate at the time of reset of interest rates.
In a notification, it said in respect of EMI-based floating rate personal loans, in the wake of rising interest rates, several consumer grievances related to elongation of loan tenor and/or increase in EMI amount, without proper communication with and/or consent of borrowers have been received.
In order to address these concerns, RBI asked entities regulated by it to put in place an appropriate policy framework.

‚ÄúAt the time of sanction, REs shall clearly communicate to the borrowers about the possible impact of change in benchmark interest rate on the loan leading to changes in EMI and/or tenor or both. Subsequently, any increase in the EMI/ tenor or both on account of the above shall be communicated to the borrower immediately through appropriate channels,‚Äù RBI said.
It further said that at the time of reset of interest rates, Regulated Entities (REs) should provide an option to borrowers to switch over to a fixed rate as per their board-approved policy.
The policy, RBI added should specify the number of times a borrower will be allowed to
switch during the tenor of the loan.
Borrowers should also be given a choice to opt for enhancement in EMI or elongation of tenor or for a combination of both options.

Karnataka Education Reforms
Continuing with making changes in the education system, the Karnataka government has issued an order to conduct annual exams for students of classes 5, 8, 9 and 11 (first PUC) for the 2023-24 academic year. Students of classes 10 and 12 will have to appear for boards. The annual exams for the students of Class 5, 8, 9 and first PUC will however be applicable only to schools and colleges with state board syllabus.
The state government also allowed the Karnataka State Examination and Assessment Board (KSEAB) to conduct a total of three annual exams for classes 10 (SSLC) and 12 (second PUC), which will be effective from 2023-24 academic year. With this the school education department of Karnataka will be doing away with the concept of supplementary examination for SSLC and second PUC. The objective of this reform is to destress students and improve their overall performance.

The Mumbai-based auto major, which on Thursday introduced all-new versions of its Nexon EV and Nexon (internal combustion engine), said it will start experimenting with new outlets in some of the cities where EV volumes have gone up.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to separate them (sales outlets for EVs and ICE) given that we have different requirements of customers and also a growing portfolio (of EVs)‚Äù Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Managing Director Shailesh Chandra told PTI in an interaction.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the company would look at places where it would be viable to have exclusive outlets for the EV range.
‚ÄúWe need to separate outlets because there would not be enough space to keep both EVs, ICE models at the same place..So there‚Äôs a practical difficulty‚Ä¶ we will not be able to do justice to both. So you will start seeing exclusive outlets starting slowly from the coming quarters,‚Äù Chandra stated.
Tata Motors‚Äô current EV portfolio comprises the flagship SUV Nexon EV range, Tiago EV, Tigor EV and the XPRES-T EV.
When asked about the locations where the exclusive outlets would come up, Chandra said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll start with pilot cities. I can‚Äôt disclose the locations right now. But as I said that within this financial year, we‚Äôll start with some experiment.‚Äù The company recently introduced the new retail identity for its unit Tata Passenger Electric Mobility. Tata Motors utilises the shop-in-shop concept in its existing dealerships to retail EV models.

Chandra said the demand for EVs is witnessing an upward trend and for Tata Motors, the EV range accounts for 13-15 per cent of the company‚Äôs overall sales.
‚ÄúRevenue wise it will be 18-20 per cent as of quarter one. Next three to four years I would imagine this to go up to 25 per cent,‚Äù he added.
Tata Motors expects electric vehicles to account for half of its passenger vehicle sales by 2030, Chandra said. The new Nexon.ev is priced between Rs 14.74-19.94 lakh (ex-showroom). It comes with a maximum range of 465 km in a single charge.

The model can charge another compatible EV and can also power external gadgets, appliances such as electrical camping equipment, power tools and a variety of consumer electronics devices.
Chandra stated that EV customers constitute a unique community that is fast growing and distinguished by their evolved choices and hunger for next-gen technology.
‚ÄúThe Nexon.ev aptly fulfils their evolving, astute preferences with a technologically advanced, on-the-move solution that seamlessly blends with their contemporary way of life,‚Äù he added.
The company also introduced the Nexon with petrol and diesel engines with introductory prices starting from Rs 8.09 lakh (ex-showroom). Chandra said the compact SUV segment, in which Nexon competes with the likes of Maruti Brezza, Hyundai Venue, Kia Sonet, has grown very steeply over the years.
‚ÄúWhen we had launched Nexon in 2017, this segment used to see sales of 30,000 units a month, today it has grown to 90,000 units a month,‚Äù he noted.

This is the most intensely fought segment as well with all the leading players having a product in the market, Chandra said.

"Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup: Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh, who are Tendulkar and Dhoni fans, will spearhead India against Pakistan","Fresh from the euphoria of winning the U-19 World Cup, India will bank on their explosive teenagers to deliver at the senior level.","There are uncanny similarities between Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh. Both are nursing their father‚Äôs shattered cricketing dreams. They spent most of their childhood watching and listening to cricket stories from their fathers. At Rohtak, Sanjeev never pursued his dream due to financial constraints, whereas in Siliguri, Manabendra Ghosh never made it beyond the club level.
Interestingly, their cricketing journey started after watching cricketing gods ‚Äî Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni. For Shafali, it all started when she watched Sachin Tendulkar‚Äôs last Ranji Trophy match at Lahli. For Richa, it started after watching MS Dhoni‚Äôs World Cup winning six from her hometown in Siliguri.
Around three years back in front of a packed MCG, they suffered heartbreak in the Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup final. A couple of weeks ago, the duo helped India to lift the inaugural U-19 Women‚Äôs World Cup.
On Sunday India will start their World Cup campaign on Sunday against their arch-rivals Pakistan and in the absence of Smriti Mandhana, India will be banking on their explosive teenagers to step up at the senior level.
Their power-hitting is very natural, and that‚Äôs what caught the attention of their respective coaches ‚Äì Shib Shankar Paul and Ashwani Kumar.
‚ÄúRicha can hit sixes at will. She can just stand and hit it out of the park. Her strength is very natural. At present, she is one of the cleanest strikers in this Indian cricket team,‚Äù Paul, a former Bengal and India A medium pacer, told The Indian Express.
‚ÄúShe likes Dhoni because of his six-hitting prowess,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúThe heartbreak of 2020 is not healed yet, but winning the U-19 title was a big confidence booster for Shafali. She has got the taste of winning. For any athlete, there is no better thing than the habit of winning. It is a team game and I believe this Indian team can go all the way, considering their talent and depth in the squad,‚Äù said Sanjeev.
Both Kumar and Paul have one concern about their wards‚Äô eagerness to hit every ball for a boundary.
‚ÄúWith time she will realise that she can‚Äôt hit every ball for a four or six. To keep the bowler under the pump is her game, she has terrorised the world‚Äôs best bowlers, but at the same time you can‚Äôt throw away a good start. She is still 19 and called it an exuberance of youth, but that‚Äôs her game and that keeps me on edge. In recent times, she has worked on her strike rotation, which I must say is a pleasing development,‚Äù Kumar, a former Haryana Ranji Trophy coach, had said.

On the other hand, Paul, a bowler himself, feels at crunch moments, Richa must play with calculated aggression. ‚ÄúBeing brave is great but you must win the battle. What is the point if she scores an 8-ball 15 and ends up on the losing side. I want her to be calculative in her approach, because her role in the team is as a finisher. I have been telling her this everytime we train or talk ‚Äì to be patient and that it is okay to play a couple of dot balls,‚Äù said Paul.

"Falling in love changes our brain, finds new study","A new study has found that falling in love can change the way your brain works, making you put your loved one on a pedestal.","We already know that being in love changes the brain by releasing the so-called ‚Äúlove hormone‚Äù oxytocin. A new study has found out that when we are in love, our brain reacts differently, making the object of our affections the centre of our lives.
Researchers from The Australian National University (ANU), the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia (UniSA) worked together to measure how a part of the brain is responsible for putting our loved one on a pedestal when we fall in love. The study published in the journal Behavioral Science investigated the link between the human brain‚Äôs ‚Äúbehavioural activation system‚Äù and romantic love.

"Sania Mirza, one of India‚Äôs greatest tennis players, gets fitting Grand Slam farewell","Trendsetter on court, and champion of breaking stereotypes off it, 36-year-old Sania Mirza leaves the Grand Slam stage where she belongs - in the final.","Sania Mirza fought back the tears as she spoke on the Rod Laver Arena for the last time. She was typically self-assured and understated in her achievement ‚Äì reaching the final of her farewell Grand Slam at the Australian Open. ‚ÄúIf I cry ‚Äì these are happy tears, not sad ones,‚Äù she said.
It was not meant to be for her and compatriot Rohan Bopanna, who were defeated 6-7 (2), 2-6 in the summit clash in Melbourne by Brazilians Luisa Stefani and Rafael Matos. Even though she was unable to lift the trophy, the stage ‚Äì one of the most iconic courts in the history of tennis ‚Äì was fitting for her farewell.
This is where Sania belongs ‚Äì the final stages of a Grand Slam. She is one of the most successful players at this stage in India‚Äôs history, with six titles. She won the Australian Open twice before, once in mixed doubles in 2009 alongside Mahesh Bhupathi, and then again in women‚Äôs doubles alongside Martina Hingis in 2016 ‚Äì her last Major title.

Despite all the incredible highs she saw in her career on the doubles tour, it will always be the 36-year-old‚Äôs pathbreaking performances as a young woman on the singles tour that define her career.
The six-time Grand Slam doubles champion revealed after her semifinal win on Wednesday that the most special moment of her career was actually a 1-6, 4-6 defeat in the third round in Melbourne Park back in 2005, when an 18-year-old Sania came up against the sport‚Äôs greatest competitor.
‚ÄúMy professional career started in Melbourne‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt think of a better arena to finish my [Grand Slam] career at.‚Äù
We love you, Sania ‚ù§Ô∏è@MirzaSania ‚Ä¢ #AusOpen ‚Ä¢ #AO2023 pic.twitter.com/E0dNogh1d0
‚Äî #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 27, 2023
‚ÄúFor me the most special memory remains playing against Serena (Williams) here when I was 18 years old, even though I lost that match, got blown off the court,‚Äù she said after her semifinal win on Wednesday.
‚ÄúHonestly, that was when belief was installed there that this is where I belong and this is where I want to be. Even though Serena won the tournament that year, for me, it made me believe that as a young Indian girl, the dream that I had to play in the slams, try and win them, was something that happened that year for me in 2005.‚Äù

And 2005 would end up being a defining year for her. She went on to win her first WTA title in Hyderabad ‚Äì to this date, the last ATP or WTA singles title won by an Indian. Later that year, at the US Open, the then-19-year-old would go on to script more history, becoming the first Indian woman to reach the second week of a Grand Slam, losing in the fourth round ‚Äì the deepest run any Indian has made at a Major singles event since Ramesh Krishnan in 1987.
ADVERTISEMENT
For 10 years, before moving on to play only doubles, Sania remained India‚Äôs No.1 singles player, reaching a career-high ranking of World No. 27 in 2007.
Her impact would go beyond that, and the 91 weeks she spent as the World No. 1 doubles player, and the 43 doubles titles she won on tour, and the iconic, thunderous forehand that left many opponents in its wake. Before the likes of Mary Kom, PV Sindhu, and Saina Nehwal would gain worldwide recognition, Sania was the leading light for women‚Äôs sport in the 21st century.
For a young Muslim woman playing at a competitive level, in a globally televised commercial sport, Sania was forced to deal with a level of scrutiny most would not have to. The criticism she has had to field has been far-ranging. The manner of her appearance and outfits on court were relentlessly scrutinised, she was once absurdly accused for disrespecting the national flag, her patriotism was questioned due to her marriage to a Pakistani cricketer, and she was questioned about when she was going to settle down and start a family ‚Äì to fit traditional gender-norms.

There was never anything traditional about the pathbreaking journey Sania already began by the time she was a teenager, and true to form, she dealt with the criticism in the bold, self-assured manner in which she has dealt with so many opponents on the court.
ADVERTISEMENT
She knew how much influence her platform gave her (Sania has 10.9 million followers on Instagram, Naomi Osaka, the world‚Äôs highest-paid female athlete, has 2.7 million). She spoke out against domestic violence, gender pay gaps, and female foeticide, and most of all, against the stereotypes Indian women have to face to make it in professional sport.
‚ÄúThere are parents who have come and said, ‚ÄòOh, you know that my young girl wanted to do something out of the box and we want her to be like you‚Äô,‚Äù she told the Straits Times, proudly, before the final in Melbourne.
Sania had, beyond the odds, come back to compete on the professional tour after the birth of her son, Izhaan, who is now four years old and has joined her in Melbourne, even reaching the semifinal at Wimbledon last year.

Sandeep Reddy Vanga on being told to seek psychiatric help: ‚ÄòIf I barge into critics‚Äô office with a rifle‚Ä¶‚Äô,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga said that he diluted the violence in a few scenes in Animal, because he felt it would be 'too much' for Indian audiences.","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga‚Äôs latest film, Animal, faced criticism for its violence and unapologetic toxic masculinity, despite emerging as one of the biggest blockbusters of Indian cinema history.

The filmmaker has now revealed that he has ‚Äòdiluted‚Äô the violence in the film to make it more palatable. 
In an interview with Komal Nahta, Vanga said, ‚ÄúTo be frank, I have diluted a few scenes, because I felt it would be too much for the Indian audience.

I myself go to the theatres and watch movies, so I always match my IQ with the audience, I keep it directly proportional.‚Äù

Because he needs to understand that this is not what I am doing in real life, this is cinema, this is art, this is expression. I will make a few scenes uncomfortable, that‚Äôs the quality of the film, that‚Äôs the quality of art. It will upset you, it will provoke you, it will irritate you.

Vanga recently commented on critics, drawing parallels with what happened after the release of his previous film, Kabir Singh. According to him, many critics lack knowledge and education about film craft, often overlooking aspects like editing and sound design in their reviews. In an interview with Connect FM Canada, he said, ‚ÄúIn a way, I understood their mental status and their IQ. If morality comes into the picture, then you can‚Äôt make this film. If everybody is going to focus just on the morality, we should stop making films. Let‚Äôs just make cartoons.‚Äù

With India, IPL used to be a fall guy a while back though these days no one carps about it. Now, Australia have dusted up the old T20 league bashing, blaming Big Bash for their poor performance in the first Test at Nagpur.
In a provocatively titled piece ‚ÄòHow the Big Bash compromised Australia‚Äôs tour of India‚Äô The Sydney Morning Herald lets rip.
There was a big push for the Big Bash,‚Äù a source told SMH. ‚ÄúIt was comfortably the shortest preparation time we‚Äôve ever had for a tour of India.‚Äù
The newspaper then spoke to Steve o Keefe, the spinner who stunned India in the first Test at Pune in 2017, who talked up the preparation last time around. They had based first in Dubai for a long camp, where they played a couple of practice games.
‚Äú‚ÄúThe wickets probably didn‚Äôt resemble a lot of what we got in India. However, they were slow, they were low. There was a lot of heat.‚Äù
They also played a tour game in Mumbai at the Brabourne stadium where both teams scored in excess of 400 in their first innings. Keefe valued that experience.

‚Äú‚ÄúIt got me conditioned physically, it got me conditioned mentally, it got me conditioned on how I was going to ball on those wickets. It got me talking to the batters and got the group together. I really rated it, and even though it was a green top I still bowled 20-odd overs and took three wickets. It was great.‚Äù In memory, it wasn‚Äôt a green top, though, but that‚Äôs besides the point.

Keefe spoke about how the current preparation ‚Äì the 4-day camp in Bangalore and a few sessions at the North Sydney ‚Äì wasn‚Äôt ideal. ‚ÄúOur batters maybe didn‚Äôt get as much out of it as what they would have liked, but you‚Äôre still batting in the heat, there‚Äôs still something to be taken out of it. I think just going over there for a few nets sessions and having a scarified wicket at North Sydney doesn‚Äôt compare. But you‚Äôve got to put that trust in that group as well and what they think is the right way to prepare.‚Äù

A loss would mean exiting yet another Asian Cup at the group stages, a draw would leave them at the behest of other results and only a win can keep their hopes of moving onto the Round-of-16 alive.
If Australia is a tough team to beat in Asia, Uzbekistan is no different. Ranked 68th in the world, the Uzbeks are age group wizards at the Asian football level, showing their best from the U17-U23 levels and only usually succumb at AFC-level tournaments to the likes of Japan. Their senior national team narrowly lost to Australia in the previous Asian Cup on penalties and many believe that the central Asian giants will occupy one of the eight slots that the continent has for the 2026 World Cup.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/afc-asian-cup-indias-plan-against-uzbekistan-hold-fort-launch-sorties-9114439/,sports

Vaishnaw had said that the government will come out with new guidelines to fight deepfakes and Chandrasekhar had asked social media firms to update their user policy as per the IT rules notified in October 2022.

Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price was increased by 7,728.38 per kilolitre, or 8.5 per cent, in the national capital to Rs 98,508.26 per kl, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.
Rates, which vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT, have been increased on firming up of global rates that followed four months of decline.

The hike comes on the back of a 1.65 per cent or Rs 1,476.79 per kl increase in ATF prices effected from July 1.
Prior to that, rates had been cut on four occasions.
Price of commercial LPG, used in establishments such as hotels and restaurants, on the other hand, was reduced by Rs 100 per cylinder.

Commercial LPG rates were cut on three previous monthly revisions beginning April. In three cuts, prices had gone down by Rs 346.5 per 19-kg cylinder.

Google reaches tentative settlement in US Play Store lawsuit,They argue that Google has unlawfully mandated that some apps use the company's payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales.,"Alphabet‚Äôs Google on Tuesday tentatively settled a class action suit alleging that its U.S. Play Store had violated U.S. federal antitrust rules by overcharging customers, according to a court filing.
Details of the settlement were not disclosed.
In the action brought by more than 30 U.S. states and representing 21 million consumers, the plaintiffs had claimed that consumers might have spent less on apps and had more options if it weren‚Äôt for Google‚Äôs alleged monopoly.
Parties to the settlement, including lawyers representing the attorney general for Utah which is leading the group of states, asked that a trial scheduled for Nov. 6 be canceled.

Google, which had denied wrongdoing, declined to comment on the proposed settlement. Lawyers for the consumer plaintiffs declined to comment on the proposed settlement, while a lawyer for plaintiffs that include the states and the District of Columbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement is subject to approval by the court.
Google is facing similar lawsuits which allege that it has generated enormous profit margins from its Play Store by engaging in illegal tactics to preserve monopolies in selling Android apps and in-app goods.
They argue that Google has unlawfully mandated that some apps use the company‚Äôs payment tools and give Google as much as 30% of digital goods sales.
Epic Games, which has brought such a claim, is not a party to the proposed Google Play settlement, founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

"TRAI moots entry fee cut for mobile, other tel service licences; suggests merger of bank guarantees","TRAI recommended the merging of FBG and PBG for Mobile Number Portability license, into a single Bank Guarantee, and favoured submission of electronic bank guarantee (eBG) for ease of doing business.","Telecom regulator TRAI on Tuesday recommended a cut in the entry fee for mobile and other telecom service licences, and favoured merging of bank guarantees, in a bid to facilitate entry of new players and promote ease of business for existing ones.
In a sweeping set of recommendations, the sector regulator has mooted that the entry fee for Unified Licence (UL) in case of access service be halved, which along with suggestions of merging bank guarantees and other measures will ‚Äúfacilitate the orderly growth of the sector‚Äù. The measures will spur investment and growth, and in effect improve the quality of service and enhance consumer welfare, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).
‚ÄúEntry fee for following UL authorisations should be rationalised‚Ä¶Access service from Rs 1 crore to Rs 50 lakh for each telecom circle/ metro area; from 0.5 crore to 25 lakh for J&K and North east each,‚Äù TRAI release said.

For internet service providers in the national area, TRAI recommended reduction in entry fee by a third ‚Äì from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. For ISP category B it recommended reduction from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 50,000 for each telecom circle, and Rs 25000 for Jammu and Kashmir and North-East each.
TRAI has also recommended no entry fee at the time of renewal of licence.
‚ÄúFor Unified License, Financial Bank Guarantee (FBG) and Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) should be merged into a single Bank Guarantee for securitizing the dues, to cover the violation of license conditions and to ensure the performance under licence agreement,‚Äù TRAI release said summarizing the recommendations made to Telecom Department.

TRAI recommended the merging of FBG and PBG for Mobile Number Portability license, into a single Bank Guarantee, and favoured submission of electronic bank guarantee (eBG) for ease of doing business.
‚ÄúIn an environment of rapid technological transformation in the telecommunications sector, in order to facilitate the orderly growth of the telecom sector and Ease of Doing Business, TRAI has made recommendations to the Government for reducing the entry fees across various license authorisations and the merging of bank guarantees,‚Äù TRAI said. TRAI said the reduction in entry fee is expected to lead to the entry of new service providers in the market, increase investment and enhance competition in telecom sector. The merging of bank guarantees will encourage ease of doing business and enable licensees to make investments in the sector thereby ushering the growth in the sector.
Both these measures will improve the quality of service and enhance consumer welfare, TRAI said. ‚ÄúThe Authority has also recommended no entry fee at the time of renewal of license. Such a move will ease the financial burden on existing, as well as new entrants, and will be beneficial for UL (VNO) licensees especially,‚Äù it explained.

The league has been reporting the insults to the Spanish soccer federation and to local authorities, and said it would do the same this time after ‚Äúintolerable racist insults against Vin√≠cius were again observed.‚Äù
The league said it was ‚Äúworking with RCD Mallorca to identify those responsible in order to take all necessary legal measures.‚Äù To speed up the process, the league said it created an email (StopRacismo@laliga.es) so fans who may have images or knowledge of those responsible can make contact and help it file the appropriate complaints.

Authorities were yet to find those responsible for hanging Vin√≠cius‚Äô effigy before the game against Atletico, and so far teams have not been punished for the racist insults against the Brazilian inside their stadiums.
An anti-violence committee said it was studying punishment to the Valladolid fans who insulted Vin√≠cius in a match in December, which could include fines of 4,000 euros ($4,300) to each individual identified, as well as banning them from sports venues for one year.
Last year a large group of Atletico fans chanted ‚ÄúVin√≠cius, you are a monkey‚Äù outside Metropolitano Stadium, but Spanish state prosecutors closed a probe into the case citing a lack of evidence and downplayed its seriousness because the chants allegedly came within the rivalry setting of a soccer match.
The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward I√±aki Williams a few years ago.

Vin√≠cius has been outspoken about the attacks against him but has yet to comment on the events from Sunday.
Real Madrid has also complained about how Vin√≠cius, a speedy attacker known for his nifty dribbles, has been targeted by opposing players on the field. Valencia defender Gabriel Paulista was sent off in a game last week after a vicious foul on the Brazilian. Vinicius was also roughed up several times against Mallorca.
The 22-year-old Vin√≠cius was also recently engulfed in controversy for his dancing in goal celebrations.

IND vs AUS: Michael Kasprowicz wants Australia to prioritise seam ahead of spin in Indore Test,"With skipper Pat Cummins and batter David Warner ruled out of the contest, the tourists are likely to welcome back Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green.","Former Australian fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz has come up with different advice to the struggling Aussies ahead of the third Test in the Border Gavaskar Trophy starting from Wednesday in Indore.
Expecting Cameron Green and Mitchell Starc‚Äôs return to the playing XI, Kasprowicz said on SENQ Breakfast, ‚ÄúComing up to this Test match with the line-up, Cameron Green is going to be picked. You‚Äôll have Starc in for Cummins for other reasons he (Cummins) can‚Äôt be there. Green will come into the middle order, he may come in for Warner with the changes there.‚Äù
Starc suffered the injury to the middle finger of his bowling hand and was sidelined as Australia lost the opening two tests of the four-match series against India.

Bharti Airtel ‚Äî which competes in the market with Reliance Jio as also Vodafone Idea ‚Äî saw its Q2FY24 total revenue climb 7.3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 37,044 crore ‚Äúbacked by strong and consistent performance in India operations‚Äù.
Net income (after exceptional items) at about Rs 1,341 crore, was 37.5 per cent lower than the year-ago period. Net income (before exceptional items) stood at nearly Rs 2,960 crore.

‚ÄúAfter accounting for loss of Rs 16,190 million towards exceptional items (net of tax and non-controlling interests) ‚Ä¶the resultant net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 came in at Rs 13,407 million, compared to a profit of Rs 21,452 million in the corresponding quarter last year and profit of Rs 16,125 million in the previous quarter,‚Äù Bharti Airtel said in its quarterly report on Q2 earnings.
India business posted quarterly revenues of Rs 26,995 crore, which was up 10.9 per cent year-on-year. Mobile services India revenues rose 11 per cent year-on-year, led by strong 4G/5G customer additions and increase in ARPU, the telco said.
Airtel Business revenue was up 9.5 per cent YoY, backed by synergies from connectivity solutions.
Mobile ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) increased to Rs 203 in Q2‚Äô24 against Rs 190 in Q2‚Äô23, buoyed by ‚Äúsustained focus on acquiring high value customers and improved realisations‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe continue to deliver industry leading ARPU along with growing average data usage per data customer at 21.7 GBs/month,‚Äù the company said in a release.
Mobile data consumption was up 19.6 per cent on-year with consumption per customer pegged at 21.7 GB per month.
‚ÄúThis has been yet another quarter of solid revenue growth and improved margins. Our India revenue continues to gain momentum and grew sequentially by 2.4 per cent. Our consolidated revenue, however, was impacted by the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira,‚Äù managing director Gopal Vittal said.

The company recorded 7.7 million 4G/5G net subscribers addition and exited the quarter with an ‚Äúindustry-leading ARPU of 203‚Äù, he added.
‚ÄúOur postpaid and homes businesses continued their strong growth trajectory as we added the highest ever net adds in both these segments in any single quarter. Our performance is underpinned by a simple and consistent strategy of focusing on quality customers and delivering the best experience to them in a seamless digital way,‚Äù Vittal further said.
According to Airtel, the postpaid segment saw highest ever net adds of 1 million in Q2‚Äô24 thereby reaching a customer base of 43.9 million (including IoT).
‚ÄúWe continue to garner strong market share of 4G/5G customers and added 27.2 million 4G/5G data customers to our network over last year, an increase of 12.9 per cent year-on-year,‚Äù it said.
Airtel said homes business maintains its rapid growth trajectory and delivered a revenue growth of 23.3 per cent year-on-year, result of the company‚Äôs strategy to harness the growing demand of high-speed and reliable broadband in India.

Explaining the one-time charge, Airtel said on October 16, 2023, the Supreme Court pronounced a judgement on tax treatment of adjusted revenue linked Variable Licence Fee (VLF) payable to the telecom department since July 1999 and held that it is capital in nature and not revenue expenditure for the purpose of computation of taxable income.
While the decision does not per se alter the total amount of VLF allowed as deduction over the licence period, it creates a timing difference wherein later years would have a higher deduction.

‚ÄúThis has resulted in an additional tax provision of Rs 2,263 million primarily due to change in effective tax rate on account of adoption of new tax regime. The interest charge of Rs 13,500 million on the above matter has been presented as an exceptional item,‚Äù Airtel said in its quarterly report.
Additionally, exceptional item includes a charge of Rs 220.3 crore on account of re-assessment of regulatory levies. ‚ÄúThe tax credit on above re-assessment amounting to Rs 554 million is included under the tax expense / (credit). The net share of loss allocated to non-controlling interests on the above exceptional items is Rs 1,221 million,‚Äù Airtel said.

Since 2020, Midhun has significantly enhanced his reputation as a screenwriter and two films he penned ‚Äî Garudan and Phoenix ‚Äî hit the screens in November 2023, achieving success and garnering positive responses. Notably, neither of these movies bore any resemblances to Anjaam Pathiraa, despite being thrillers, heightening expectations for Ozler, penned by Randheer Krishnan.

My goal right now is to win the World Cup: Pakistan skipper Babar Azam,While Pakistan only played a total of nine ODI matches in 2022 - losing just once in that span to Australia at home - Babar's side has a host of 50-over matches lined up over the coming months that will help them prepare for the World Cup that is scheduled in India later this year.,"Two-time ICC Men‚Äôs ODI Player of the Year Babar Azam has achieved almost everything possible in 50-over cricket over the last 24 months, but there is one more thing he is missing and dearly wants to achieve ‚Äì leading Pakistan to the ICC Cricket World Cup title in India later this year.
Babar has been a force to be reckoned with in 50-over cricket in recent times, still holding on to the No.1 spot on the ODI Player Rankings since July 2021 and deservedly named the ODI Player of the Year for the last two years.
In that time Babar has amassed a mountain of runs and his form has helped Pakistan remain one of the best teams in one-day cricket as the Asian side has closed in on the No.1 team ranking.
The Pakistan captain knows exactly what he wants to achieve in 2023 üí•

But while the personal accolades continue to flood in for Babar, team success is ultimately what he really strives for and the 28-year-old will get the chance to achieve this later this year at the ICC Men‚Äôs Cricket World Cup.
‚ÄúThe ambition is to be a part of the World Cup team and to win the tournament,‚Äù Babar told ICC Digital when asked what his career ambition was.
‚ÄúThe World Cup is coming up and my ambition is to perform well so that we can win it. You see a lot of things individually too, but my goal right now is to win the World Cup,‚Äù added Azam.
While Pakistan only played a total of nine ODI matches in 2022 ‚Äì losing just once in that span to Australia at home ‚Äì Babar‚Äôs side has a host of 50-over matches lined up over the coming months that will help them prepare for the World Cup that is scheduled in India later this year.

‚ÄúYou cannot really jump to your goal. You have to achieve it step by step. The mindset is to go step by step, but yeah you have it in the back for your mind that you need to perform well.

Will increase interest rates if cost of funds rises: SBI Chairman,"As per a recent SBI research report, the banking industry will require Rs 84,000 crore of excess capital or five per cent increase on Rs 15.2 lakh crore capital requirement following the RBI decision to tighten the risk weights on unsecured loans.","State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Khara on Wednesday said the RBI‚Äôs move to raise risk weights on consumer credit, credit card dues and lending to NBFCs may result in an increase in the interest rates by the bank.

Williamson surpasses Taylor as New Zealand‚Äôs most prolific test batter,"The former captain hit paceman James Anderson through midwicket for four with the fourth ball of the morning at Wellington's Basin Reserve on day four to pass Taylor's mark of 7,683 runs.","Kane Williamson cemented his claim as New Zealand‚Äôs greatest test batsman after he eclipsed Ross Taylor as the nation‚Äôs leading run-scorer on the way to an inspirational century against England in the second test on Monday.
The former captain hit paceman James Anderson through midwicket for four with the fourth ball of the morning at Wellington‚Äôs Basin Reserve on day four to pass Taylor‚Äôs mark of 7,683 runs.
By tea, Williamson had chalked up his 26th century in tests to give the hosts some hope of pulling off an unlikely win after they were asked to follow on.
As always, the mild-mannered 32-year-old from Tauranga kept the emotions in check, barely acknowledging the warm applause from the crowd after taking the runs record.
Later in the day, after being caught behind for 132 off Harry Brook‚Äôs part-time medium pace, Williamson showed he has lost none of his discomfort talking about his achievements.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something that I‚Äôve sort of thought about a whole lot but it is an honour,‚Äù he told reporters of the record.
‚ÄúI look at that list and I‚Äôve admired all of those players over the years, whether that‚Äôs watching from afar growing up or playing alongside a number of them as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a focus point, but it‚Äôs special to be amongst that company.‚Äù
A nation of 5 million, New Zealand has produced a slew of brilliant cricketers over the decades but none have made their mark with the bat quite like Williamson.
Taylor‚Äôs tally of runs came from 112 matches, while Williamson, now on 7,787 runs at an average of 53.33, is playing his 92nd test.
Former team mate Taylor, who retired last year, was quick to congratulate him.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThis achievement is a testament to your hard work and dedication to test cricket, of which I was privy to for a number of years,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs to many more.‚Äù
Williamson managed only 10 runs across his three previous innings of the series against England but answered the team‚Äôs call for a big score on Monday.
He batted superbly through a 282-ball knock, anchoring partnerships with Henry Nicholls (29), Daryl Mitchell (54) and Tom Blundell (90) in New Zealand‚Äôs second innings of 483.
Tim Southee‚Äôs side will bid to record just the fourth win in history by a team asked to follow on.
ADVERTISEMENT
Should they pull it off, they will have their quiet talisman Williamson to thank for setting up the chance.

‚ÄòWe respect Allan Border but ‚Ä¶‚Äô Alex Carey offers Australian‚Äôs team official response to Border‚Äôs accusation that they were too soft and friendly to India,"Allan Border, who was called Mr Grumpy in his captaincy days, went after Steve Smith for giving a ‚Äòthumb‚Äôs up‚Äô gesture to an Indian bowler after he was beaten.","First reactions have come from the Australia team over a bizarre but in-character comment from Allan Border over the way Steve Smith behaved in the first Test.
Border, who was called Mr Grumpy in his captaincy days, went after Steve Smith for giving a ‚Äòthumb‚Äôs up‚Äô gesture to an Indian bowler after he was beaten. It‚Äôs something that Smith has done throughout his career, part of his mannerisms, but Border, who had predicted that Australia would win the series 2-1, pounced on him to make a point.
‚ÄúPlay with a harder edge. I mean, we‚Äôre giving blokes the thumbs up when they‚Äôre beating us outside the off stump,‚Äù Border said.‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on? That is just ridiculous. Don‚Äôt go stupid, but Australia play hard nose cricket. We‚Äôre even giving someone thumbs up ‚Ä¶ bloody hell.‚Äù
While Smith happenned to trigger Border, his larger point was that Australia were a bit soft.
Now, Alex Carey, the Australian wicketkeeper who was very good behind the stumps and kept sweeping in front of it, served the first official response from the Australian team.
‚ÄúWe highly respect Allan Border,‚Äù Carey said. ‚ÄúI guess among the group, guys do it differently. We come up against these players a lot.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably alluding to the Steve Smith comment more than any but, you know, he‚Äôs mates with a lot of them. And that‚Äôs the way he [Smith] plays. He does it in all situations. He plays around with his hands and does all that stuff. And I think that‚Äôs probably what gets him pretty focused.
‚Äú‚ÄúThey‚Äôre obviously strong comments but, as a group, we believe in what we‚Äôre doing and come the second Test we‚Äôre ready to put a few learnings into place.‚Äù

Of the Australian players, Carey showed the greatest inclination to deploy the sweep shot. He fell to reverse sweep in both innings.
‚ÄúIt will be my downfall at times, I‚Äôll have success with it at times,‚Äù Carey said. ‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs been onto me quite a bit about it, so [you] might not see it for a little while.‚Äù
‚Äú[I was] maybe a little bit too keen to play a different style, but I guess in my first Test over here that‚Äôs not a bad learning to have. Hopefully, I can find that balance along with all our players as well. We obviously want to be proactive, but calm and patient, and we had a pretty good look at that first hand with a few of their players.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/we-respect-allan-border-but-alex-carey-offers-australians-team-official-response-to-borders-accusation-that-they-were-too-soft-and-friendly-to-india-8443455/,sports
Mutual Funds: Understanding Tax saving Funds and How SIP and Lumpsum Routes Differ,"When it comes to tax-saving funds, the choice between SIP and lumpsum routes holds significant implications for investors. Bajaj Finserv mutual funds platform not only provides a diverse range of tax saving mutual funds but also introduces innovative tools like the lumpsum calculator.","Tax saving mutual funds have become an integral part of the financial strategy in 2023. This is not just for financial growth but also for optimising tax liabilities. As we delve into the intricacies of these funds, the choice between the SIP (systematic investment plan) and lumpsum routes emerges as a crucial decision for investors. 
This article navigates through the features of tax saving mutual funds (equity linked saving schemes), exploring the distinctions between SIP and lumpsum investment options, and introducing the innovative lumpsum calculator to empower investors in making informed decisions.
Understanding tax saving mutual funds:
Why tax saving mutual funds?
Tax saving mutual funds, also known as equity linked saving schemes (ELSS), present a unique opportunity for investors to not only build wealth but also enjoy tax benefits. With a mandatory lock-in period of three years, these funds offer tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, making them an attractive avenue for those looking to optimise tax outflows while participating in the potential growth of the equity market.
The SIP advantage
ADVERTISEMENT
Systematic investment plans (SIPs) within tax saving mutual funds provide a disciplined and systematic approach to investing. With SIPs, investors contribute a fixed amount at regular intervals, navigating market volatility effectively. This strategy utilises the power of rupee cost averaging, allowing investors to buy more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high. Over time, this approach minimises the impact of market fluctuations on the overall investment.
The lumpsum appeal
On the flip side, the lumpsum route involves a one-time investment in tax saving mutual funds. While it lacks the periodicity of SIPs, lumpsum investments offer the potential for significant gains if timed well. Investors with a lumpsum amount, whether from a bonus, inheritance, or other windfalls, can capitalise on market opportunities by deploying a substantial amount in one go.
Divergence in approaches: SIP vs. lumpsum
Risk management
SIPs provide a risk mitigation mechanism through rupee cost averaging, ensuring that market volatility works in favour of the investor. In contrast, lumpsum investments are more susceptible to immediate market fluctuations, potentially exposing investors to higher short-term risks.
Market timing
SIPs offer a strategic advantage by eliminating the need for precise market timing. Investors contribute regularly, benefiting from market fluctuations over time. Lumpsum investments, on the other hand, require careful consideration of market conditions for optimal entry, making timing a critical factor in maximising returns.
Psychological comfort
ADVERTISEMENT
SIPs provide psychological comfort by removing the pressure of timing the market perfectly. Investors contribute consistently, irrespective of short-term market movements, fostering a disciplined and stress-free investment approach. Lumpsum investments may induce psychological stress as investors face the challenge of deciding the opportune moment for a significant one-time investment.
Introducing the lumpsum calculator from Bajaj Finserv
Why a lumpsum calculator?
In the pursuit of informed investment decisions, Bajaj Finserv mutual funds platform introduces the lumpsum calculator. This innovative tool is designed to empower investors with a projection of their lumpsum investments potential growth. By inputting key variables such as the investment amount, expected rate of return, and investment tenure, investors gain valuable insights into the future value of their lumpsum investments.
How to use the lumpsum calculator?
Utilising the Bajaj Finserv lumpsum calculator is straightforward. Investors input the lumpsum amount they plan to invest, the expected rate of return, and the investment tenure. The calculator then generates a detailed projection, illustrating the potential future value of the investment over the specified period. This foresight enables investors to align their lumpsum investments with their financial goals.
Benefits of the lumpsum calculator
ADVERTISEMENT
The Bajaj Finserv lumpsum calculator offers several advantages for investors:
Strategic planning: Investors can strategically plan their lumpsum investments by adjusting variables like the investment amount and tenure to align with specific financial goals.
Risk assessment: By providing a projection, the calculator aids in assessing the potential risks and rewards associated with lumpsum investments, helping investors make well-informed decisions.
Goal alignment: The calculator facilitates goal-oriented investing by illustrating how lumpsum investments can contribute to specific financial objectives, whether it is buying a home, funding education, or planning for retirement.
Conclusion
When it comes to tax-saving funds, the choice between SIP and lumpsum routes holds significant implications for investors. Bajaj Finserv mutual funds platform not only provides a diverse range of tax saving mutual funds but also introduces innovative tools like the lumpsum calculator. Whether you opt for the disciplined approach of SIPs or the potential gains of lumpsum investments, Bajaj Finserv mutual funds ensures a seamless and rewarding investment journey. Explore the possibilities, leverage the lumpsum calculator, and embark on a path to maximise your wealth through tax saving mutual funds.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sponsored-business/mutual-funds-understanding-tax-saving-funds-and-how-sip-and-lumpsum-routes-differ-9086037/,business

IOC president Bach urges Ukraine to drop Paris boycott threat,The IOC has said a boycott will violate the Olympic Charter and that its inclusion of Russian and Belarusians is based on a U.N. resolution against discrimination within the Olympic movement.,"International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has called on Ukraine to drop threats of a boycott of the 2024 Olympics over the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes.
Ukraine hopes to secure widespread international support for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes after the IOC opened the door for them to compete as neutrals in Paris.
Athletes from Russia and neighbouring Belarus, which aided Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine a year ago, have been banned from many international competitions since.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the IOC to ban Russia from the Olympics, and Olympic bodies and lawmakers in the Nordic and Baltic regions have backed Ukraine.
In a letter to Ukraine‚Äôs National Olympic Committee (NOC) president Vadym Huttsait, seen by Reuters, Bach said claims that allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes back into the Games would promote the invasion were ‚Äúdefamatory‚Äù.
The IOC has said a boycott will violate the Olympic Charter and that its inclusion of Russian and Belarusians is based on a U.N. resolution against discrimination within the Olympic movement.
‚ÄúThe participation of neutral athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 has not even been discussed in concrete terms yet,‚Äù Bach said.

‚ÄúTherefore, your letter‚Ä¶ to your fellow NOCs, to the International Federations, IOC Members and to future Olympic hosts, pressuring them in an attempt to publicly influence their decision making, has been perceived by the vast majority of them as, at the very least, extremely regrettable.

The IOC announced last month that athletes from the two countries might be allowed to earn slots for the Olympics through Asian qualifying and compete as neutrals, with no flags or anthems.

Chinese firms look to Malaysia for assembly of high-end chips,"The companies are asking Malaysian chip packaging firms to assemble a type of chip known as graphics processing units (GPUs), according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.","A growing number of Chinese semiconductor design companies are tapping Malaysian firms to assemble a portion of their high-end chips, keen to hedge risks in case the U.S. expands sanctions on China‚Äôs chip industry, sources said.
The companies are asking Malaysian chip packaging firms to assemble a type of chip known as graphics processing units (GPUs), according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The requests only encompass assembly ‚Äì which does not contravene any U.S. restrictions ‚Äì and not fabrication of the chip wafers, they said. Some contracts have already been agreed, two of the people added.
ADVERTISEMENT
The people declined to disclose the names of the companies involved or to be identified, citing confidentiality agreements.
Seeking to limit China‚Äôs access to high-end GPUs that could fuel artificial intelligence breakthroughs or power supercomputers and military applications, Washington has increasingly placed restrictions on their sales as well as on sophisticated chip-making equipment.
As those sanctions bite and an AI boom fuels demand, smaller Chinese semiconductor design firms are struggling to secure sufficient advanced packaging services at home, analysts have said.
Some of the Chinese companies are interested in advanced chip packaging services, two people said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Advanced packaging of chips can significantly improve chip performance and is emerging as a critical technology in the semiconductor industry. This sometimes involves the construction of chiplets where chips are packaged tightly to work together as one powerful brain.
Although not subject to U.S. export restrictions, it‚Äôs an area that can require sophisticated technology which the firms worry might one day be targeted for curbs on exports to China, the two people added.
Malaysia, a major hub in the semiconductor supply chain, is seen as well placed to grab further business as Chinese chip firms diversify outside of China for assembling needs.
Unisem, majority owned by China‚Äôs Huatian Technology, and other Malaysian chip packaging companies have seen increased business and inquiries from Chinese clients, said one source who was briefed on the matter.
ADVERTISEMENT
Unisem Chairman John Chia declined to comment on the company‚Äôs clients but said: ‚ÄúDue to trade sanctions and supply chain issues, many Chinese chip design houses have come to Malaysia to establish additional sources of supply outside of China to support their business in and out of China.‚Äù
Chinese chip design firms also see Malaysia as a good option because the country is perceived as being on good terms with China, is affordable, with an experienced workforce and sophisticated equipment, two of the sources said.
Asked whether accepting orders to assemble GPUs from Chinese firms could potentially provoke U.S. ire, Chia said Unisem‚Äôs business dealings were ‚Äúfully legitimate and compliant‚Äù and the company did not have the time to worry over ‚Äútoo many possibilities‚Äù.
He noted that most of Unisem‚Äôs customers in Malaysia were from the United States.
ADVERTISEMENT
The U.S. Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.
Other big chip packaging firms in the country include Malaysian Pacific Industries and Inari Amertron. They did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Chinese companies are also interested in having their chips assembled outside China as that could also make it easier to sell their products in non-Chinese markets, said one source, an investor in two Chinese chip startups.

Malaysia currently accounts for 13% of the global market for semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing and is aiming to boost that to 15% by 2030.

Chinese chip firms that have announced plans to expand in Malaysia include Xfusion, a former Huawei unit, which said in September it would partner with Malaysia‚Äôs NationGate to manufacture GPU servers ‚Äì servers designed for data centres and which are used in AI and high-performance computing.
Shanghai-based StarFive is also building a design centre in Penang, and chip packaging and testing firm TongFu Microelectronics said last year it would expand its Malaysia facility ‚Äì a venture with U.S. chipmaker AMD.
Offering an array of incentives, Malaysia has attracted multi-billion dollar chip investments. Germany‚Äôs Infineon said in August it would invest 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) to expand its power chip plant there.
U.S. chipmaker Intel announced in 2021 that it would build a $7 billion advanced chip packaging plant in Malaysia.

Chinese companies are not just choosing Malaysia. In 2021, JCET Group, the world‚Äôs third-largest chip assembly and testing company, completed an acquisition of an advanced testing facility in Singapore.
Other countries such as Vietnam and India are also seeking to expand further into chip manufacturing services, hoping to lure clients keen to minimise U.S.-Sino geopolitical risks.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/chinese-firms-look-to-malaysia-for-assembly-of-high-end-chips-9072398/,technology

She said that the experience of doing a film in an unfamiliar language brought her closer to her mom.","One of the highlights of Jr NTR‚Äôs upcoming film Devara: Part 1 is that it marks the debut of Bollywood actor Janhvi Kapoor in the Telugu industry. In a recent interview with Film Companion, Janhvi opened up about how making her debut in Telugu is like a ‚Äòhomecoming‚Äô for her. Janhvi‚Äôs mother, Sridevi, was a superstar back in the day in both Tamil and Telugu cinema, before she chose to shift her focus to Bollywood. Working in Devara, Janhvi was able to understand what her mom did decades ago.
Talking about working in Devara, she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of fun. I am having a blast. I think I have gotten to a point where, after doing all these films wherein I am dying in a freezer, dislocating my shoulder, or acting with a rat, I realise I am allowing myself to do what comes naturally to me which is like nautanki, dialoguebaazi, dancing, and just having fun. And doing the kind of roles I have grown up enjoying and loving. I am finally getting to do all in this film. I think I am going easier on myself and allowing myself to enjoy it. I think this is the perfect film to be able to do that.‚Äù

"Kangana Ranaut echoes Smriti Irani‚Äôs statement on paid menstrual leave: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs periods, not some illness or handicap‚Äô",Kangana Ranaut said that women don't a paid period leave as she shared Smriti Irani's statement.,"After Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani said in Rajya Sabha that paid menstrual leave could lead to discrimination against women in the workforce, actor Kangana Ranaut has echoed her statement and said that menstruation is not ‚Äúsome illness or handicap‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen don‚Äôt need paid leave for periods.‚Äù
Kangana took to her Instagram stories and shared, ‚ÄúWorking woman is a myth, there hasn‚Äôt been a single non-working woman in the history of mankind, from farming to house chores to raising kids, women have always been working and nothing has come in the way of their commitment to their families or community or nation. Unless it‚Äôs some specific medical condition, women don‚Äôt need paid leaves for periods, please understand it‚Äôs periods not some illness or handicap.‚Äù
Earlier, Smriti Irani, who was previously an actor in television and films, had spoken about this in Rajya Sabha. ‚ÄúGiven today women are opting for more and more economic opportunities, I will just put my personal view on this, I am not the officiating ministry. We should not propose issues where women are in some way denied an equal opportunity just because somebody who does not menstruate has a particular viewpoint towards menstruation,‚Äù she said. Smriti was responding to a query on whether the government is looking into providing a law for menstrual leave.

She appeared in the Tamil film Chandramukhi 2 which managed to do decently well in the south but did not generate any noise in the norther belt, which is Kangana‚Äôs core fan base.

Tottenham declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Earlier, the Financial Times reported MSP Sports Capital is working with a consortium of investors to structure the bid and that it is weeks away from formally approaching the club‚Äôs owner Joe Lewis and chair Daniel Levy.
The report said that the Najafi and MSP-led offer would value Tottenham, who are fifth in the Premier League, at approximately $3 billion before adding about $750 million of debt on the club‚Äôs books. It added that MSP and its partners will put forward 70% of the purchase price, while backers from the Gulf, mainly from Abu Dhabi, will contribute the rest 30%.
Najafi is also a minority shareholder in the National Basketball Association team Phoenix Suns. Tottenham, currently managed by Antonio Conte, have 39 points after 23 games in the league this season and sit two points outside the top four.

"EU watchdog scrutinises banks‚Äô defences after SVB, Credit Suisse woes","Recent banking crises in the United States, where Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and in Switzerland where UBS was forced to acquire Credit Suisse, show that banks and regulators need to increase preparedness for rapidly unfolding crises, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) said.","Most leading euro zone banks have met a January 2024 target for issuing special debt to replenish capital in a crisis, but some need to do more to ensure they can, if necessary, be wound up quickly, a European Union regulator said on Wednesday.
Recent banking crises in the United States, where Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and in Switzerland where UBS was forced to acquire Credit Suisse, show that banks and regulators need to increase preparedness for rapidly unfolding crises, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) said.
Forcing banks in the EU‚Äôs banking union to have minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) was a lesson from the 2008 global financial crisis where taxpayers had to bail out banks.
ADVERTISEMENT
MREL debt is written down in a crisis to ‚Äúbail in‚Äù the bank and help stop it from being ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù.
The SRB, which sets MREL targets, said that by the end of 2022, two-thirds of banks met their final target.
The shortfall is 0.3% of total risk exposures or 20.5 billion euros ($21.87 billion). Some 2.7 trillion euros has been issued so far, and 24 banks have an MREL shortfall, though 14 of them have been given an extension until the end of 2024 or 2025 to meet their targets.
‚ÄúWhile holding sufficient loss-absorbing resources at all times is key, it is equally important for banks to be able to use these funds in a crisis,‚Äù the SRB said in a report.
ADVERTISEMENT
Its focus is shifting to ensuring banks can credibly demonstrate by the end of this year that they can be smoothly ‚Äúresolved‚Äù or wound down, restructured, or sold without disruption to customers.
‚ÄúThe SRB will review whether material shortcomings remain and take remedial action where needed,‚Äù it said, though there is no sign so far that it will need to intervene.
Evaporating liquidity was a hallmark of recent banking turmoil and is being scrutinised in resolution plans of banks.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúIn order to foster consistency across banks‚Äô scenarios to be considered while integrating lessons learnt from recent crisis cases, the SRB will develop further guidance on the assumptions to be used,‚Äù the watchdog said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/eu-watchdog-scrutinises-banks-defences-svb-credit-suisse-woes-8946283/,business

Periodic table chapter dropped from Class 10 NCERT science textbook in ‚Äòrationalisation‚Äô exercise,"The Class 11 chapter in the Chemistry textbook on the same topic, however, has been retained","‚ÄúThe Periodic Table is arguably the most important concept in chemistry, both in principle and in practice‚Ä¶.An awareness of the Periodic Table is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle the world and see how it is built up from the fundamental building blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements.‚Äù
The chapter on ‚ÄòClassification in Elements and Periodicity in Properties‚Äô in NCERT‚Äôs Class 11 Chemistry textbook begins with these words of American chemist Glenn T Seaborg. Yet, a full chapter, which introduces students to the topic, has been removed from NCERT‚Äôs Class 10 Science textbook as part of the council‚Äôs ‚Äúrationalisation‚Äù exercise. The Class 11 chapter on the topic, however, remains part of the syllabus.
The deletion from the Class 10 textbooks was made by the NCERT in June 2022, saying, ‚ÄúIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students.‚Äù Among other deletions, made last year, from the class 10 Science textbook include passages on ‚ÄòEvolution‚Äô. The new textbooks with deletions and changes made last year have now hit the market.
‚ÄòEvolution‚Äô, including the Darwininian theory on natural selection, remains a part of the school curriculum though as NCERT‚Äôs Class 12 Biology textbook has a full chapter on the subject. Among other topics which have been spiked from Science textbooks include chapters on Fibre and Fabrics in Classes 6, 7 and 8.
The Class 6 chapter on the topic had a reference on Mahatma Gandhi in the context of charkha. ‚ÄúAnother hand operated device for spinning is charkha. Use of charkha was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi as part of the Independence movement. He encouraged people to wear clothes made of homespun yarn and shun imported cloth made in the mills of Britain,‚Äù it said.

Another deletion that stands out is of the chapter ‚ÄúWhy do we fall ill‚Äù from Class 9 Science textbook. Ironically, the chapter introduces students to viruses and air-borne diseases such as Covid-19, citing which the rationalisation exercise was carried out by the NCERT.
‚ÄúSuch disease-causing microbes can spread through the air. This occurs through the little droplets thrown out by an infected person who sneezes or coughs. Someone standing close by can breathe in these droplets, and the microbes get a chance to start a new infection. Examples of such diseases spread through the air are the common cold, coronavirus disease (Covid-19), pneumonia and tuberculosis,‚Äù read a paragraph in the chapter which was updated after the pandemic broke out.

But the entire chapter was axed citing the need to reduce content load due to disruptions in learning caused by Covid-19. Apart from its in-house experts, the NCERT had roped in 25 external experts, drawn from the faculty of Delhi University, ICHR, various Kendriya Vidyalayas and private schools for carrying out the rationalisation.

WhatsApp calls not ringing on your iPhone? Here are 5 things to try,Discover the top 5 reasons your iPhone might be giving WhatsApp calls the silent treatment.,"Plenty of iPhone users have found themselves missing calls without explanation. The phone didn‚Äôt ring, buzz, or notify you, leaving you scrambling to explain why you didn‚Äôt pick up. Luckily, a little detective work usually reveals the culprit. Here are four reasons your iPhone may fail to alert you about an incoming WhatsApp call.
Connection issues
One of the top reasons your iPhone won‚Äôt notify you of a WhatsApp call is a weak or unstable internet connection. Spotty connections disrupt the signal between devices, preventing calls from coming through. Before blaming your device, check your connection bars. If low, switch location or toggle between mobile data and Wi-Fi. If the problem persists across connections, there could be a different issue at play.

"Before becoming an MP, Harbhajan Singh consulted Sachin Tendulkar",Sachin Tendulkar told Harbhajan Singh that he should commit to being an MP only if he is sure about devoting enough time.,"Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, who is a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament nominated by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said that he had consulted his close friend and batting legend Sachin Tendulkar before joining politics. Tendulkar also had a term as a Rajya Sabha MP starting 2012.
‚ÄúI have the most respect for Paaji (Tendulkar). He has made me feel so comfortable. We became very close because there was that comfort and I think he enjoyed my company as well. Then I started speaking in Punjabi to him and we both used to enjoy talking to each other. If I ever need advice, I always go to him. Even before joining the Rajya Sabha, I talked to him. He told me that I was getting an opportunity to serve my country and that I should only commit if I could give the job time. I thought that was good advice. Now this is my new innings ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know how long it will go, just that I do it well,‚Äù Harbhajan Singh said during an Idea Exchange session with The Indian Express.

Talking about the switch from cricket to politics, Harbhajan said his innings in parliament is a learning experience.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an altogether different field for me. I have spent 20-odd years in cricket and enjoyed every bit of it. Today, whatever I am is because of the game. Even the reason why I was given the MP seat is because I am Harbhajan Singh, the cricketer. I am still very new, very raw in politics and trying to know how things work. Being at Parliament sessions, meeting the big people of our country, the decision-makers is an experience, sharing my knowledge, getting to know their mind in a lot of different aspects of life and what is happening in India is obviously a big learning. The more time I spend in it, the more I am trying to learn from different people. I try to keep as much track as I can of these political agendas, what is happening in India and try to raise the same issues in Parliament and also what is happening recently in Delhi with mayor and stuff and BJP and AAP,‚Äù Harbhajan said.
When asked about the clashes in the MCD House after the mayor election, Harbhajan said ‚Äòit was not the right thing to do‚Äô. The Aam Aadmi Party‚Äôs Shelly Oberoi was elected as the mayor of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on Wednesday.

Yorkshire admit four charges after investigation into racism claims,"Yorkshire and a number of individuals were charged by the ECB in June after an investigation into racism claims made by former player Azeem Rafiq, who alleged in 2021 that he had been a victim of institutional racism at the club.","Yorkshire County Cricket Club has admitted liability to four amended charges including a failure to address and take adequate action against racist and discriminatory language, the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Tuesday.
Yorkshire and a number of individuals were charged by the ECB in June after an investigation into racism claims made by former player Azeem Rafiq, who alleged in 2021 that he had been a victim of institutional racism at the club.
The scandal rocked English cricket and led to numerous changes in coaching and administrative personnel at Yorkshire.
‚ÄúYorkshire CCC has admitted liability in response to four amended charges, including a failure to address systemic use of racist and/or discriminatory language over a prolonged period and a failure to take adequate action in respect of allegations of racist and/or discriminatory behaviour,‚Äù the ECB said.
Rafiq‚Äôs former team mate Gary Ballance, who played 23 tests for England before switching allegiance to Zimbabwe, also admitted liability for his use of racially discriminatory language, the ECB added.
Rafiq, a former England Under-19s captain of Pakistani descent, told a British parliamentary committee in 2021 of ‚Äúinhuman‚Äù treatment at Yorkshire and described the sport in England as riddled with racism.
Ballance has previously apologised to Rafiq in person for using racist language.

Both Yorkshire and Ballance will not be required to attend a hearing in London following the acceptance of the charges.
An independent panel of the Cricket Discipline Commission, the body that handles disciplinary matters in the English domestic game, will hear the cases from March 1 to March 9.
Ex-Yorkshire players Tim Bresnan, John Blain, Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Gale and Richard Pyrah have all withdrawn from the hearing.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement is an important step forward for Yorkshire County Cricket Club as part of its journey to learn from the past,‚Äù Yorkshire chairman Kamlesh Patel said in a statement.

Shah Rukh delivered the three biggest hits of his career in the same calendar year in 2023, reclaiming his position as the country‚Äôs biggest star.
Karan has often spoken about the kind of allure that movie stars used to have, and told Forbes that he finds this quality lacking in the actors that have followed.

Karan added, ‚ÄúEven now, when Rekha walks into an event, heads turn. That‚Äôs a movie star. When Aishwarya walks the red carpet at Cannes, when Mr Bachchan is anywhere, they‚Äôre movie stars.

That majestic magnetism only he has. He‚Äôs irreplaceable.‚Äù
Karan said that there will be ‚Äòmany actors‚Äô in the future, but ‚Äòthere never was and never will be a personality like Shah Rukh Khan‚Äô. Karan and Shah Rukh have worked together on films such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, and My Name is Khan.

"Punjab National Bank Q1 net profit jumps four-fold to Rs 1,255 crore",The government on July 20 had banned the export of non-basmati white rice to boost domestic supply and keep retail prices under check during the upcoming festive season.,"The International Monetary Fund has said it would ‚Äúencourage‚Äù India to remove restrictions on export of a certain category of rice, which, it said, would have an impact on global inflation.
The Indian government on July 20 had banned the export of non-basmati white rice to boost domestic supply and keep retail prices under check during the upcoming festive season. This type of rice constitutes about 25 per cent of total rice exported from the country.
There would be no change in export policy of par-boiled non-basmati rice and basmati rice, which forms the bulk of exports, the food ministry had said in a statement.

In the current environment, these types of restrictions are likely to exacerbate volatility on food prices in the rest of the world. They can also lead to retaliatory measures, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist, International Monetary Fund (IMF), told a press conference here.
‚ÄúSo, they are certainly something that we would encourage the removal of these types of export restrictions, because they can be harmful globally,‚Äù he said in response to a question.
The total exports of non-basmati white rice from India was USD 4.2 million in 2022-23 as against USD 2.62 million in the preceding year. Major destinations of India‚Äôs non-basmati white rice exports include the US, Thailand, Italy, Spain and Sri Lanka.
In order to ensure adequate availability of non-basmati white rice in the domestic market and to allay the rise in local prices, the government has amended the export policy from ‚ÄòFree with export duty of 20%‚Äô to ‚ÄòProhibited‚Äô with immediate effect. The IMF in its latest economic update released here on Tuesday projected India‚Äôs growth rate to be 6.1 per cent for fiscal year 2024, which is slightly up from 5.9 per cent estimated projection for the same period in April.

‚ÄúIndia remains an economy that is growing quite strongly. I mean, it‚Äôs coming down from really a very strong year in 2022, at 7.2 per cent. That was also revised upwards, by the way ‚Äî but still slow down, but still fairly strong growth and fairly strong momentum,‚Äù Gourinchas said.
Later in an interview, when asked about India‚Äôs rice export ban, Daniel Leigh, Division Chief, IMF Research Department, told PTI that the context is clearly, an environment of declining inflation around the world.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs important because then it allows monetary policy to ease up and not to start increasing interest rates, which means currencies move around,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe see it in the interest of the overall global community to keep that food and energy inflation trend down. Now the challenge is that if we see restrictions in other countries as well as India, we‚Äôve been very clear that in our view we understand the domestic consideration, but if you see that global impact, then that would go against the reduction in inflation. So our perspective is that such restrictions should be phased out as soon as feasible,‚Äù Leigh said.
He also said that India‚Äôs digital public infrastructure is really world class and it is enabling efficiency gains for businesses.
‚ÄúReally what is great to see is India sharing its experience with the other members of the G20. Under its presidency of the G20, India is helping to spread the understanding and the opportunities and the risks that we need to talk about when it digitises more generally,‚Äù he said.
The Indian economy, Leigh said, has already been very robust. ‚ÄúBut the reforms when it comes to female labour force participation to make it easier for women to stay in the workforce, for the youth to find the kind of training that they need. This is a very dynamic economy. The question is how to maximize the potential,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs economy is growing strongly and also inflation is in the range of the central bank target. So those are positive things and the growth forecast itself is for growth of 6.1 per cent this year. This means that basically 16 per cent of the world economy, one in six of the world‚Äôs economic growth is coming from India,‚Äù he said, Referring to the upward revision of the Indian growth projections, Leigh said this is mainly because of what happened at the end of last year. More government investment, more private investment, give it the economy boost and that has a knock on effect for this year, he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúNow we do see growth continuing to be above six next year as well, 6.3 per cent and in the medium term about six per cent. This is the kind of above average growth for the region that is really going to help economic well being,‚Äù Leigh said.
Noting that the IMF expects India‚Äôs inflation to be at 4.9 per cent and then 4.5 per cent next year, he said the monetary policy action really deserves a lot of the credit for this 250 basis point increase in the interest rate since May of last year. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also though the fortunate decline that all of the countries are benefiting from in food and energy prices globally. This is also driving inflation down,‚Äù Leigh said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/non-basmati-white-rice-imf-india-remove-export-restrictions-8860981/,business

Vicky Kaushal says he met wife Katrina Kaif‚Äôs family only one week before wedding: ‚ÄòI danced to ‚ÄòTip Tip Barsa Paani‚Äô in front of them‚Äô,Vicky Kaushal revealed what happened after he got drinking and dancing with Katrina Kaif's family.,"Actors Vicky Kaushal and Kiara Advani graced the latest episode of Koffee with Karan season 8. Host Karan Johar was all smiles and excited to host the duo, who were previously seen together in the film Govinda Naam Mera. From spilling beans about their spouses to sharing hilarious anecdotes, the duo left Karan in splits with their antics. 
In a fun segment, Karan asked Vicky and Kiara, ‚ÄúFun story about breaking the ice with your in-laws.‚Äù Vicky shared his story first and said, ‚ÄúIt was a fun episode. Fun in the sense it‚Äô not comic but it was genuinely a lot of fun because I couldn‚Äôt meet for two years because of Covid, so I met them literally like the week before marriage and we had a party at my place. We were all drinking and dancing and it was like instantly we saw each other in the worst form.‚Äù

"‚ÄòEarlier, stars were launched. Now if an actor does two good scenes, he will get better opportunities‚Äô","At a recent Adda held in Delhi, actor Vicky Kaushal and filmmaker Meghna Gulzar spoke on the making of their film on Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, what defines stardom and writing with nuance","On whether it‚Äôs possible to be a star and remain authentic
Gulzar: Whether it‚Äôs possible or not I don‚Äôt know, but it should be prescribed because I think the audience sniffs artificiality and that comes in the way. My mother was a star in her own right at a time when there was no social media. So that was just pure and raw stardom. I think stardom is also different things to different people. For him (Vicky), I think, it is getting the adulation and the approval of his audience for his work more than the trappings that stardom is known for. This is a very personal interpretation of what stardom is or should be, but I don‚Äôt see his lacking or wanting in any way.
On his breakout role in Masaan
Kaushal: At that time, I was just a boy looking for opportunities, a very hungry and stubborn boy. I auditioned for Masaan (2015) and got selected. Apart from Richa Chadha and Sanjay Mishraji, it was everybody‚Äôs first film. So it was made with a lot of purity. It was a lot of novices coming together with a lot of passion for that breakout opportunity. I went to Banaras about three weeks before we started shooting and tried to just be one with the place. Apart from learning the language, the culture, about the Dom community (that cremates bodies), I had an audio track which was just ‚ÄòRam Naam Satya Hai‚Äô. I used to put that on my headphones and would try to sleep to that music. At first, it used to be very haunting but I tried it because for the boy Deepak (the character he plays, who belongs to the Dom community) it must have been his lullaby. He has lived there only. I spent a lot of time at the cremation ground. I remember the first time I went there, I couldn‚Äôt sit there for 15 minutes but eventually I was able to spend days over there, was able to have a cup of tea right next to a burning pyre and say ‚Äòshakkar kam hai‚Äô (the sugar is less). So it was just surrendering to that whole world.

From setting up campus to being top-ranked: IIM Bangalore director Rishikesha T Krishnan reflects on institute‚Äôs 50-year long journey,"By offering high-quality MBA programmes and creating managers who are leading some of India's most important business enterprises, IIM Bangalore is making significant contributions to the nation, says institute director Rishikesha T Krishnan.","The Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB), one of the leading business schools of India, was the third IIM to be established in 1973, after IIM Calcutta and IIM Ahmedabad. The institute will kickstart its golden jubilee celebrations on Thursday.
IIM Bangalore was formally inaugurated by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 28, 1973, and its journey began from rented premises on Langford Road in Bengaluru. The reputed business school is spread over a 100-acre campus on Bannerghatta Road, initially designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Dr BV Doshi.
In 1973, IIM Bangalore started with the first Post Graduate Programme (PGP) batch of around 50 students. The two-year PGP batch commenced in July 1974 and the first convocation was held on July 10, 1976, with 48 students graduating. In the past 50 years, the institute has grown exponentially and now has around 1,200 students across various degree-granting programmes and 5,000 annual executive education participants. The institute boasts of over 25,000 alumni who occupy positions of global leadership.

Rishikesha T Krishnan, director of IIM Bangalore, joined the institute in 1996 and has since then served it in different capacities. He took charge as the director of the institute on July 20, 2020. He talked to indianexpress.com about IIMB‚Äôs contribution to the nation, taking charge during the Covid-19 pandemic, the importance of research and more. Some excerpts from the interview:
Q: You took charge as the director of IIM Bangalore right when the Covid took over the world. How did you manage this challenge?
Krishnan: IIMB was pretty quick in adapting to the challenges posed by the Covid pandemic. We had experience with online education due to MOOC (massive open online course) activities since 2014. Therefore, several faculty members were conversant with what it takes to do effective teaching online.
During the 2020-21 academic year, quite a few courses were offered in the online format. While that particular year was quite badly affected because of the lockdown, the following year (2022) ‚Äì even as Covid continued ‚Äì we were able to slowly get back to life on campus. Though some classes were being held online, students were able to attend them from the hostel. Students were able to carry on with other activities in the hostel. Of course, there were disruptions, but I think the positive side is that we were able to adapt quickly and provide a good online learning experience.

Q: IIMB is completing 50 years of inception. Could you please tell us some of the main landmarks of these past five decades?
Krishnan: IIMB was started with a vision to provide managerial talent to drive the public sector. We also tried to create a central focus on other sectors like agriculture, energy, rural development etc as part of the curriculum.
Fast forward to the mid-80s, the philosophy of the country also started changing. The public sector was no longer the focus of all investment and attention. Even though the formal liberalisation process started in 1991, many people believe the seeds of liberalisation were sown a little earlier than that. Reflecting on this, we also became more oriented towards general management and started having a focus on corporate, but certainly in a more explicit way from the early 1990s.

We have also tried to use our location in Bengaluru to further the interests of the institute as well as our stakeholders. In 1998, we got into a collaboration with the IT industry and started a weekend MBA programme. The reason for launching this programme was since the IT industry was about to take off, they did not have the strength of management capability which they required to sustain that growth.
Around 2000-2001, we realised that we need to be present in public policy in a different way. After the first 10 years of liberalisation, it was clear while the private sector would drive the economy, there was a need for the government to provide a good regulatory framework, ensure there is a level playing field etc. At that time, IIMB decided to start another new postgraduate programme in Public Policy and Management to create the managerial and policy talent needed to drive policy-making and regulatory activities. This was supported by the Government of India and some external funding agencies like UNDP [United Nations Development Programme].
Somewhere in the middle of the decade, around 2005-2006, we also took a deliberate decision that we needed to enhance both the quality and quantity of research work being done. When the institute started, it focused more on teaching, and though there was research, a lot of it only focused on the sectors which I mentioned earlier.

So, in 2005-06, we decided to put a greater focus on rigorous academic research, resulting in publications in top journals. The initiatives taken back then were surely successful as now we are widely recognised as a research-intensive management institution in India.
In 2014, IIMB decided to adopt the new emerging technology of digital learning. So we set up a MOOCs platform with edX, a US-based platform started by Harvard and MIT. We became one of the partners of edX and since then we have offered more than 16 different courses on the platform.

Q: IIMB is known (among the alumni community) to have a ‚Äògo-getter‚Äô atmosphere‚Ä¶
Krishnan: Today, there are a lot of opportunities, be it companies conducting contests, startup opportunities, and much more. The biggest challenge for students is how to use their time effectively in the face of so many different exciting things that are happening.
ADVERTISEMENT
We have a good incubator on campus and a lot of exciting things happening in startups. Students have access to go and talk to these companies; sometimes these startups also give projects to students. Many of our faculty members are involved actively in a lot of interesting projects, and sometimes they make some of those opportunities open to the students as well. We bring in a lot of interesting guest speakers, industry leaders, startup founders, and so on ‚Äì some of these events happen in formal settings and others in informal settings.
Students also have events that they organise on their own such as Vista, Eximius and more.

In a way, through this, students show that now in India it is not just about a classroom activity, but overall experience where students have an opportunity to experience a wide range of things. Our job is to nudge them and ensure that they maintain some balance between all these different opportunities. This way, students come out with good skills and capabilities to be successful in the industry.
Q: IIM Bangalore became quite known after the shooting of the Bollywood flick ‚Äò3 Idiots‚Äô. Do you think it helped bring the institute into the spotlight?
Krishnan: In the US, several campuses got visibility as they allowed shooting films on campus. I can only guess that might have also been in the minds of the IIMB administration when they encouraged the shooting of ‚Äò3 Idiots‚Äô, in addition to the positive messaging of the movie.
I was living on the IIMB campus when the movie shooting took place, and a lot of my long-lost friends suddenly rediscovered me during those days because they all wanted to come and see the shoot.

Earlier, Aamir Khan stayed somewhere else but after struggling through the city traffic on the first day of shooting, he decided to move to our campus. He stayed in the IIM Bangalore hostels for a few months. Every evening he would play badminton or some other game with the students. He used to frequently walk around the campus.
There have been some changes too with this. Earlier, the famous water tank used to be open but now we have restricted entry to that water tank as we do not want anybody getting up on top and then slipping and falling.
It is certainly something which has made the IIMB campus known in the country and even internationally. Now, most people come to the campus and wish to visit the famous spots from ‚Äò3 Idiots‚Äô. On YouTube, there is a video which allows you to map the different scenes in ‚Äò3 Idiots‚Äô to the actual locations. I have seen people wandering around with their phones in their hands and trying to locate the spots.
Q: IIMBx, the MOOC section of IIMB is facilitating access to highly qualified academicians. What are your plans for expanding the reach?
Krishnan: In 2014, we embraced MOOCs by becoming an edX partner resulting in over 50 high-quality management courses offered globally on this powerful platform over the next seven years. According to a recent study, two of these courses are among the 100 most popular edX courses of all time and around 2 million learners have enrolled in our MOOCs courses since inception.
The Women Startup Program (WSP), which is an initiative carried out by NSRCEL, the entrepreneurial centre of IIM Bangalore (with support from the Department of Science and Technology in its first and second runs, and later with the support of Goldman Sachs in the third run) used the IIMBx MOOC, ‚ÄòDo Your venture: Entrepreneurship for Everyone‚Äô, for skill-development of women entrepreneurs. The MOOC was delivered to cohorts of 3,000, 6,500 and 10,000+ women in the first, second and third runs of the programme, respectively.
NIRF Rankings of IIM Bangalore over the past few years.
IIMBx partners with the National Commission for Women (NCW), India, to deliver the same MOOC to 5,800 women entrepreneurs participating in NCW‚Äôs Empowering Women through Entrepreneurship Programme.
Apart from edX, IIMBx offers courses on SWAYAM, iGOT Karmayogi (for government employees) and its own platform. Led by its faculty, IIMBx uses digital learning tools to enable anytime, anywhere learning in a global classroom.
Q: What steps has IIMB taken to address the evolving needs of the industry and to foster entrepreneurship and innovation among its students?
Krishnan: India needs high-quality MBA programmes to meet the needs of a growing economy. We play multiple roles like we are an important source of new ideas for the government and industry. For example, an IIMB study has led to the waiver of stamp duty on low-cost housing to provide a fillip to the sector.
We often play the role of neutral and unbiased experts on policy and even legal matters (the Karnataka High Court recently asked our faculty to look into an issue related to resettlement by BMRCL [Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited]).
We create the managers who lead some of the most important business enterprises. Take just one industry as an example, fast-moving consumer goods. IIMB alums head Indian giants like Marico as well as MNC Indian subsidiaries like Colgate Palmolive India.
Increasingly, we are making significant contributions to the entrepreneurial pool who are building the businesses of tomorrow ‚Äì e.g. IIMB alumni form the core of the founding team of Delhivery, which is an outstanding logistics company supporting e-commerce giants.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/from-setting-up-campus-to-being-top-ranked-iimb-director-rishikesha-t-krishnan-reflects-on-institutes-50-year-journey-8979815/,education

Bharathiraja condemns producer KE Gnanavel Raja‚Äôs comments against director Ameer,Renowned filmmaker Bharathiraja has hit out against producer KE Gnanavel Raja for his controversial statements against director Ameer.,"KE Gnanavel Raja is facing severe backlash from top directors and producers of Tamil film industry for his recent statements against director Ameer. Director-actor Samuthirakani penned a strongly-worded statement hitting out at the Studio Green producer asking him to be careful with his words. Director Sasikumar of Subramaniapuram fame also came out against Gnanavel Raja. Now, veteran filmmaker Bharathiraja has also condemned the producer‚Äôs controversial and demeaning statements against Ameer.
Bharathiraja took to social media to share a statement. In the post, Bharathiraja supported Ameer and said Gnanavel Raja‚Äôs statements are condemnable. The statement read, ‚ÄúThe issue between you and Ameer is for financial reasons. However, you have spoken about a great creator in a way to cause embarrassment to his art, which is condemnable. Ameer‚Äôs contribution in identifying you and making you a successful producer is huge and you shouldn‚Äôt forget it. Even before Paruthiveeran, Ameer has directed films and has produced one. To say that he learnt filmmaking with your money with a sly laughter is a disrespect to all creators because a creator will keep learning until death. I am learning even now. In my opinion, you have to apologise and solve the issue for disrespecting a great creator.‚Äù

"Ranji triumph is a fitting tribute to Chintu, one of Saurashtra‚Äôs favourite sons: Unadkat","""Like I'd said before it's a fitting tribute to one of Saurashtra's favourite sons, Chintu (Pujara's nickname). He played his 100th Test for India against Australia in Delhi, but he was equally eager, wishing us all throughout,"" Unadkat said.","Saurashtra skipper Jaydev Unadkat on Sunday dedicated the team‚Äôs Ranji Trophy triumph to India veteran Cheteshwar Pujara and called him one of the region‚Äôs favourite sons.
Pujara hit the winning run against Australia in his milestone 100th Test in Delhi.
‚ÄúLike I‚Äôd said before it‚Äôs a fitting tribute to one of Saurashtra‚Äôs favourite sons, Chintu (Pujara‚Äôs nickname). He played his 100th Test for India against Australia in Delhi, but he was equally eager, wishing us all throughout,‚Äù Unadkat said.
Pujara is the 13th Indian cricketer to play 100 Tests or more. He made his debut in 2010 and has scored over 7000 runs in his 13-year-long Test career.
On the latest triumph, Unadkat, who led the team to three premier domestic titles across formats in as many years, said ‚Äúthis decade and era belongs‚Äù to Saurashtra.
Saurashtra defeated Bengal by nine wickets in a replay of the 2020 final to win the Ranji Trophy for the second time. This was also their second title this season, having stamped their authority in the one-day format by claiming the Vijay Hazare Trophy in December.
‚ÄúIt was important to win this one to prove the dominance and to show everyone that this era, the decade belongs to Saurashtra,‚Äù Unadkat told reporters after their triumph.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThree trophies in three years proves that we have been doing a lot of things right. We have set a tone, I‚Äôm really proud what this team has achieved.‚Äù The 31-year-old, who made a dream Test comeback after 12 years in Bangladesh last year, was busy with India‚Äôs series against Australia. But Unadkat was ‚Äúgranted‚Äù permission to play the Ranji final.
‚ÄúAt the moment, I feel that my body is in a good shape. The ball is coming out nicely off the hand. I‚Äôm able to bowl long spells which is crucial.‚Äù Want to create a legacy for Saurashtra
Asked about his goal, he said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about winning trophies, but creating a legacy for our team which will leave a bigger impact on cricket in the region.
‚ÄúOur goal will be to carry forward this legacy for at least 3-4 years till the core of our team is intact.‚Äù Saurashtra won their maiden Ranji title three years back on the basis of a first-innings lead over Bengal on their home turf of Rajkot.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúA lot of guys said the wickets suited us better, but that wasn‚Äôt the case.
‚ÄúAll the credit to the guys for showing such dominance in a crucial game like the final. It‚Äôs not easy. There‚Äôs always pressure on everyone to win the final.‚Äù With their pace-heavy attack on an Eden greentop, it was the home side that started as favourites. No team could surpass 350 against Bengal this season but, in the summit clash, Saurashtra got past the 400-mark as the Bengal pacers failed to make use of a lively pitch.
Bengal‚Äôs batters, too, were a big letdown as their first-innings ended at 174 after Unadkat won a good toss.
‚ÄúWith all talks about bowling lineup that they have not given more than 348 in the tournament, it‚Äôs a great statement (by our batters) to achieve that in a game like final.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe bowled in the right areas to start with, better than their bowlers a lot of times. Batters showed more composure and resilience. we won a lot more sessions than them, that‚Äôs why we came out on top.‚Äù Unadkat further said Bengal were under pressure and the visitors handled the situation more calmly.

‚ÄòWow I need someone to teach me that‚Äô: Peter Handscomb recalls chat with Ajinkya Rahane over countering spin in India,"During the IPL in 2016, Handscomb shared the dressing room with Rahane. The two had a chat were the Indian spoke about how to use the feet and wrist to open up the leg side while playing spinners.","Australia‚Äôs middle-order batter Peter Handscomb has recalled how former India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane helped him combat spin bowling in the sub-continent.
During the IPL in 2016, Handscomb shared the dressing room with Rahane. The two had a chat were the Indian spoke about how to use the feet and wrist to open up the leg side while playing spinners.
‚ÄúHe was playing these shots off his back foot through midwicket which I thought were ridiculous,‚Äù Handscomb told Sydney Morning Herald.
‚ÄúI was like, wow I need someone to teach me that. So we spoke about getting his front leg out of the way and being able to manipulate the ball from there.
‚ÄúThat helps your back foot become a scoring zone, and then if they overpitch, you can hopefully score off the front foot as well. Then all their good balls you just find a way to defend.‚Äù After scoring an unbeaten 72 off 142 balls in the first innings, Handscomb, like many of his teammates, got out for a duck while attempting a sweep shot in the second essay of the second Test at Kotla.
‚ÄúIndia personally outplayed me in that situation. They gave me my scoring gap, but without the reward, so it was just going to be a single, but tempted me to hit the ball there.
‚ÄúAnd I fell for that and tried to manipulate the ball there when, had that been my third ball of the first innings, I would have just tried to defend, because I was still trying to understand the pitch and what was going on.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs just about being stronger and starting again. I probably walked out there thinking ‚ÄòI‚Äôm still on 72 not out, I can just pick up where I left off‚Äô, and you can‚Äôt think like that.‚Äù
Handscomb, who has been to India about eight times including when he was an academy scholar, feels tours are important in getting the hang of the conditions in the sub- continent.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd have sessions where no matter what the bowler was bowling, I had to hit every ball on the leg side, and then the next day and every ball had to go on the off side, and every ball had to be played off the back foot, or every ball off the front foot,‚Äù he says.
‚ÄúIt was learning what I could and couldn‚Äôt do in subcontinent tours with no repercussions. I get to try all this. It‚Äôs just so different to back home, where bounce is key for spin. So tours are crucial.‚Äù Despite conceding the Broder Gavskar Trophy after losing the first two Tests, Handscomb said the Australian camp is positive.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThe feeling around the group is one of trust in each other‚Äôs games, which is very hard to come by. We‚Äôll definitely take the positives out of Delhi.
‚ÄúWe still had a first innings lead, we‚Äôd done well there, we‚Äôd started well in the second innings and then it all just happened really fast and we didn‚Äôt stop it at any stage.
‚ÄúThe challenge is if there‚Äôs a moment where we have lost two or three quick ones, it‚Äôs being able to stop the flow for a second and let us all just take a step back, have a breath and then continue on with the game, and hopefully stem the flow of wickets that way.‚Äù As a good player of spin bowling, Handscomb was always in line to be a part of the India tour but the batter wants to be ‚Äúon every Australian tour from now‚Äù.

Giant planets like Jupiter can stop life on Earth-like neighbours,A new study has shown that gas giants in distant planetary systems can destroy life in Earth. This means that Jupiter is a black sheep as far as gas giants go since it protects life on Earth.,"Gas giants like Jupiter are massive on a scale that is difficult to understand. As many as 1,300 Earths can fit inside the volume of Jupiter. A new study shows that such giant planets can act like agents of chaos in the universe, making sure that nothing can live on its Earth-like neighbours.
In our solar system, Jupiter plays an important role as a protector. Because of its enormous gravitational field, it deflects comets and asteroids that might otherwise hit our planet. This creates a more stable environment for life. However, a study published in The Astronomical Journal in October suggests that in some planetary systems, gas giants like Jupiter can kick smaller planets out of orbit and destroy their climates.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/giant-planets-jupiter-earth-neighbours-9011942/,technology
Bayern Munich winless in 2023 and searching for answers,Bayern Munich hasn‚Äôt won a game yet this year.,"The Bavarian powerhouse has seen its Bundesliga lead shrink from four points before the World Cup to just one since the league‚Äôs return.
Three draws in three games ‚Äî all 1-1 ‚Äî to Leipzig, Cologne, then Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, have prompted another round of introspection and piled the pressure on coach Julian Nagelsmann ahead of the decisive stage of the season.
Bayern visits Mainz in the third round of the German Cup on Wednesday, two weeks before the team‚Äôs trip to Paris Saint-Germain for the first leg of their Champions League knockout clash.
Though it hadn‚Äôt been expected to make any further winter signings, Bayern was reportedly close Monday to tying up a surprise loan deal for Portugal left back Jo√£o Cancelo from Manchester City. It would give Bayern more security in defense and an added attacking threat on the left.
It‚Äôs not the first time Bayern has slumped this season ‚Äî the 10-time defending champions went four Bundesliga games without a win in September ‚Äî but this time there‚Äôs little room for error and less time to correct them.
Bayern had two weeks off to regroup after the team‚Äôs 1-0 loss at Augsburg on Sept. 17. At the time, Nagelsmann was reportedly summoned for intensive discussions with his superiors and he prepared a detailed analysis of the entire team. Kicker magazine reported that the players were amazed when Nagelsmann later pointed out their individual mistakes in personal consultations with each.
On Saturday, Nagelsmann complained that the players were making the same mistakes and a lack of confidence is playing a role. It‚Äôs a vicious circle.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWhen you don‚Äôt win, confidence isn‚Äôt so high,‚Äù Nagelsmann said. ‚ÄúWe can do a lot more to regain confidence. There are many things we could do better, and speeding up the game is a very important one.‚Äù
Bayern struggled to create chances against Frankfurt, Cologne and Leipzig‚Äôs well-organized defenses.
‚ÄúWe only play through the wings, hardly ever through the center,‚Äù Nagelsmann said after the draw with Frankfurt.
After the draw against Cologne ‚Äî also at home ‚Äî Nagelsmann said off-field distractions such as Serge Gnabry‚Äôs criticized trip to Paris Fashion Week and injuries to team captain Manuel Neuer and Senegal star Sadio Man√© were just ‚Äúexcuses‚Äù for the team‚Äôs poor form.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all professionals, they want to win games,‚Äù Nagelsmann said.
Before the league‚Äôs extended winter break, Bayern had won 10 games straight across all competitions, including wins over Inter Milan and Barcelona in the Champions League.

Devil movie review: Kalyan Ram film lacks punch,Devil review: Kalyan Ram is sincere in a film lacking originality or depth. Devil is strictly for fans of the actor.,"The success of last year‚Äôs Bimbisara still augurs well for Kalyan Ram, despite the poor show of his Amigos earlier this year. The choice of a British-era story has worked well in creating interest in this film. Samyuktha also lends support here. Pushing all these factors is producer Abhishek Nama, who raked up controversy by removing director Navin Medaram from the movie and declaring himself the chief architect of the film. Has the gamble worked? Let‚Äôs see.
Devil is all about spies, double agents working for the British or the Indian National Army headed by Subhash Chandra Bose. It is all taking place at the time when Bose is contemplating returning to India, and the British are working hard to catch him. The central stage of this drama is Rasapadu, a coastal town in Madras Presidency, with a British secret agent named Devil (Kalyan Ram) running a bigger operation pretending to solve the murder of a Zamindar‚Äôs daughter. Playing other characters of interest are Samyuktha, Vashistha Simha, Satya, Shafi, Ester, Ajay and Malavika Nair.

The Psychological Counselling Centre, set up in September this year in the New Medical College Hospital in Kota in compliance with the state government‚Äôs budget announcement, has no clinical psychologist. There is only one clinical psychologist appointed at the NMCH against the demand of at least five, and it lacks an adequate number of trained staff.
Non-availability of M Phil in clinical psychology in medical colleges of the state has further aggravated the issue as those serving in government medical colleges in the state are the degree holders from other states and are short against the demand.

The proposal was approved leading to announcement of Psychological Counselling Centre with skilled clinical psychologists.
The Psychological Counselling Centre was started (without any additional budget), however, commencement of M Phil course and appointment of clinical psychologists is still pending there, Dr Daria added.
Because of better study culture in Rajasthan, parents from across the country are getting their wards admitted in Rajasthan and a further high inflow of students is expected in Kota, Sikar and Jaipur. Clinical psychologists are in acute demand in the state, Dr Daria said while pointing out that inflow of mental health-related patients in government medical colleges in the state is sufficient enough to start with eight-seat M Phil course in clinical psychology.

India‚Äôs Ola Electric eyes higher sales with affordable e-scooters,"The new e-scooter models, S1X and S1X+, will be priced at 99,999 rupees ($1,199.15) and 109,999 rupees, respectively.","Ola Electric, India‚Äôs largest maker of electric scooters, launched its most affordable rides on Tuesday, in an effort to woo more buyers as the price of e-scooters moves closer to gasoline models.
The SoftBank Group-backed company also plans to launch four e-motorcycles by end-2024.
The new e-scooter models, S1X and S1X+, will be priced at 99,999 rupees ($1,199.15) and 109,999 rupees, respectively, with the cheapest variant of S1X about 36% lower than Bangalore-based Ola‚Äôs most expensive e-scooter, the S1 Pro, which sells for 140,000 rupees.

The least expensive gasoline scooter in India costs about 64,000 rupees.
Gasoline two-wheelers account for the bulk of automobile sales in India and crossed 5 million units last fiscal, of which electric models made up around 15%, industry data showed.
The government wants this to grow to 70% by 2030 and is offering incentives to boost sales.
Ola has launched cheaper scooters through a new generation platform, reducing production costs by 25%, founder and Chief Executive Bhavish Aggarwal told Reuters.

The company, which first began selling electric scooters in 2021 and competes with start-ups like Ather Energy, leads the e-scooter market with a 32% share. Valued at $5 billion last year, Ola sold around 95,000 e-scooters from April-August 2023, industry data showed.
While the new models will boost Ola‚Äôs market share, Aggarwal said his focus is to increase EV penetration in India and wants electric models to comprise the majority of scooter sales by next year.
‚ÄúOur goal is eventually to bring the upfront price of an EV equal to internal combustion engine models ‚Ä¶ without any government incentives.‚ÄùThe IPO-bound company also plans to expand its plant‚Äôs annual production capacity to 2 million units from 500,000 currently, and double the number of experience stores to 2,000.
Ola recorded an operating loss of $136 million on a revenue of $335 million in the fiscal ended March 2023, Reuters reported.

‚ÄúObviously they don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs going to happen if the South African Cricket Board are any indication of the future, keeping their best players at home. If I was New Zealand I wouldn‚Äôt even play the series. I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre even playing. Why would you when it shows a lack of respect for New Zealand cricket?,‚Äù Waugh told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Real Madrid favourites to keep up Europe‚Äôs dominance,"Real, who won previously in 2014 and then three successive tournaments from 2016 to 2018, are on course for a showdown with Flamengo of Brazil in the final but both must play a semi-final match first before they can set up an intriguing decider in Rabat on Feb. 11.","Real Madrid are favourites for a record-extending fifth success at the Club World Cup, and in the process keeping up European dominance over South America in the annual tournament, which kicks off in Morocco on Wednesday.
Real, who won previously in 2014 and then three successive tournaments from 2016 to 2018, are on course for a showdown with Flamengo of Brazil in the final but both must play a semi-final match first before they can set up an intriguing decider in Rabat on Feb. 11.
European clubs have won the last nine editions of the event, dominating since 2012 when Brazil‚Äôs Corinthians beat Chelsea in the final in Japan in a rare South American success.
Last year‚Äôs Champions League and Copa Libertadores winners only join once the tournament reaches the final four stage but it begins on Wednesday when Egypt‚Äôs Al Ahly, who qualify as one of two African representatives, meet Auckland City in Tangier in an opening playoff tie.
The Oceania champions from New Zealand compete for a record 10th time in the tournament against the equally experienced Cairo giants, who are at their eighth Club World Cup.
That winner advances to a quarter-final clash on Saturday against Seattle Sounders. The U.S. club won last year‚Äôs CONCACAF Champions League but had a miserable Major League Soccer campaign.
African champions Wydad Casablanca can expect passionate home support for their game the same day against Asian counterparts Al Hilal from Saudi Arabia. Wydad‚Äôs squad includes three players from the Morocco team that reached the World Cup semi-final in Qatar in December.

Flamengo will only play their first game in the semi-final on Feb. 7 and Real Madrid one day later.
The tournament will be used to experiment further tweaks to the Video Assistant Referee system as referees will, for the first time, explain the reasons for VAR decisions to the crowd at the stadium and the television audience.
During the trial, referees will relay their decisions via a microphone connected to the public address system, though their conversation with video officials will remain private.

Five First Dates movie review: A simple yet warm hat tip to the Before trilogy,"An interesting film adeptly exploring the life of a bisexual woman and the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, Five First Dates also serves as a warm nod to the Before trilogy.","Remember the first time you went out with them? Not those who turned you off instantaneously or the ones you found problematic or not worth a shot, but that one person or the ones who provided you with memorable first dates? Those moments of opening up to each other slowly, ensuring that there is no TMI, while also trying to understand their likes and dislikes, sharing the most basic of details about each other, and unexpectedly delving into serious topics in tandem.
Rinoshun‚Äôs first Malayalam feature film, Five First Dates, which was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), revolves around Shalini (Noila Francy) and depicts five different dates she went on at different points in her life, in a chronological manner starting from her college days. The film also traces her life journey, illustrating the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, with a particular focus on her gradual self-discovery and understanding of her sexual orientation.
Employing an episodic plot structure, the film begins by depicting Shalini in college, embarking on a date with a young man. Despite his regressive behaviour and offensive remarks that reveal his misogynistic and queerphobic views, Shalini, still in her ‚Äúideal girl‚Äù phase, remains somewhat naive. Even in the face of these remarks, she rarely confronts him and continues with the date. By skillfully setting a significant portion of this encounter in a park, Rinoshun also underscores the immaturity in Shalini‚Äôs thoughts and the overall nature of the date.

On the contrary, her second date takes place in a parked car when she is older. During this segment, it becomes apparent that Shalini has gradually evolved and is almost the opposite of the person she was in college. Now, she smokes, emphasising that it is not an empowerment act but a personal preference. Shalini asserts that she smokes because she enjoys it, requiring no further explanation, thereby highlighting her enhanced understanding of gender politics. Although the man in this scenario appears more progressive than the first, making nonsensical statements like ‚Äúthe purpose of life is to procreate,‚Äù Shalini doesn‚Äôt hesitate to correct him with logical facts, a departure from her former self.

Her third date, on the other hand, is far more mature, taking place with a budding filmmaker inside his flat. They engage in conversations about a variety of topics, spanning books, films, philosophies, and life. While they generally share a similar perspective on life, particularly regarding marriage ‚Äì both stressing that it‚Äôs not a priority ‚Äì they also acknowledge and discuss their differences in a mature manner. Towards the conclusion, she even expresses the possibility of envisioning herself marrying him if necessary, highlighting the warmth she experienced in the company of such a sensible person.
Moving on to the fourth date, arranged by her family with a potential groom, it begins with her frustration over his tardiness. She explicitly states at the outset that she only agreed due to her mother‚Äôs insistence and plans to leave once they conclude the meeting. However, as the conversation unfolds, she finds him intriguing. Despite being quite different from her in nature, he avoids condescension or displaying a man-child attitude. When she asks how he would react if she discovers one day that she is interested in women, he responds supportively, encouraging her to explore her actual sexual orientation by going on a date with a woman. For an older Shalini, who has likely weathered life‚Äôs challenges and is no longer the completely rebellious person she once was, this date leaves a lasting impression. Towards the end of the episode, she even reflects on the entire date during the journey home, a rare occurrence in the film up to that point.
In the last episode, Shalini is depicted on a trekking date with a schoolteacher, Afreen (Pooja Sreenan), after discovering that she is bisexual. As they explore a forest together, Afreen reveals to Shalini that trees too communicate when we focus our ears on their trunks, emphasising that she is learning more new things in this relationship. Shalini appears to be at her happiest, relishing every moment of the date. Despite fatigue from walking, she persists, choosing to be with Afreen in the present. The film concludes with the two sharing a kiss atop a hillock, where Shalini, once comfortable with PDA, now shivers as their lips meet, highlighting the excitement Afreen brings. While all the other dates are set at night, the one with Afreen occurs during the day, with the sun shining above, symbolising how this relationship has illuminated Shalini‚Äôs life.
ADVERTISEMENT
A hat tip to Richard Linklater‚Äôs Before trilogy, starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, Five First Dates even features a poster of Before Sunset on the wall in the filmmaker‚Äôs flat during the third date. An interesting film adeptly exploring the life of a bisexual woman and the evolution of her ideologies and mindset, Five First Dates ensures that the dialogues feel natural and not forced onto the characters.
Since the dates progress at a real-time pace, Rinoshun allows the actors to carry forward the moments without unnecessary interruptions. This approach extends to the inclusion of mispronunciations in the dialogues, permitting characters to correct themselves and proceed, adding an additional layer of charm to the movie.
On the performance front, Noila Francy shines exceptionally as Shalini, brilliantly capturing and bringing forth the different shades and ethos of the character at various junctures in her life. Noila even adds additional layers to the character at different points, emphasising Shalini‚Äôs growth and realisation, processing more things.
However, Five First Dates falls short on the technical side, as the film rarely explores anything visually beyond the characters, in contrast to the Before trilogy. While the limited budget may have constrained additional visual elements, better planning on Rinoshun‚Äôs part, considering his roles as cinematographer and editor, could have enhanced the film‚Äôs visual language. Simultaneously, the use of music and song placement proves to be a detractor, discordant with the film‚Äôs intended tone.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/five-first-dates-movie-review-a-simple-yet-warm-hat-tip-to-the-before-trilogy-9066376/,entertainment

‚ÄúIt was really about, how can we celebrate 75 years of television differently?‚Äù the show‚Äôs executive producer Jesse Collins told The Associated Press.
The first such scene will come within the 10 minutes of host Anthony Anderson‚Äôs Emmys opening, and the moments will be spread throughout the Fox telecast.
‚ÄúThe core of it,‚Äù said Dionne Harmon, another executive producer, ‚Äúis really celebrating television and to honor the shows of yesterday while we honor the shows of today.‚Äù
Collins, Harmon and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay from Jesse Collins Entertainment are producing the Emmys for the first time, after previously putting on the Oscars, American Music Awards and BET Awards.

With the tribute segments they‚Äôre seeking to show decades of television in its full variety of styles, formats and periods.
From the Emmys‚Äô earliest days in the 1950s will come I Love Lucy; from the 1960s, The Carol Burnett Show, whose title star recently won her seventh Emmy at age 90; from the 1970s, All in the Family, whose legendary creator, TV legend Norman Lear, died last month at 101.
  Cheers will represent the ‚Äô80s. Ally McBeal and Martin will represent different sides of the ‚Äô90s. The television-game-changing Sopranos will show up from the early 2000s.
Shows still on the air ‚Äî Grey‚Äôs Anatomy and American Horror Story ‚Äî will also be represented.

Bits featuring Saturday Night Live and The Arsenio Hall Show will show up for variety and talk.
‚ÄúWe just tried to pick ones that we felt like we could successfully pay tribute to,‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúWe have a pretty vast array of comedies and procedural dramas and talk shows, just trying to touch all the different areas.‚Äù
And the shows come from all four networks and HBO, a perennial Emmys juggernaut that this year has all three of the top nominated shows ‚Äî ‚ÄúSuccession,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe White Lotus,‚Äù ‚Äî and was home to the winningest drama of all time, which is also among the classic shows getting honored.
‚ÄúWe have a great ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô moment,‚Äù Collins said.

Producers didn‚Äôt give specifics on who will be appearing, and said not to expect everyone from every show.
Reunions aren‚Äôt possible for all of them, of course. ‚ÄúI Love Lucy,‚Äù whose key cast members have all been dead for decades, will get a recreation by actors playing Lucy and Ethel.
Other shows have few left to reunite. All in the Family only has two surviving major cast members, Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers. The same is true of The Carol Burnett Show, with only Burnett and Vicki Lawrence still alive.
They also said not to expect a reunion of the cast of Friends, though the show will include some tribute to Matthew Perry, who died in October.
ADVERTISEMENT
Emmy producers said they tried to take a different approach to each of the segments to make sure it doesn‚Äôt start to feel like a repetitive trope.
‚ÄúWe want to make sure people remain entertained and engaged so you never really know what you‚Äôre going to see, even with the reunions,‚Äù Rouzan-Clay told the AP.
While wrangling multiple actors from different eras is never easy, and synching schedules was a tangled thicket as everyone became available again with the end of the writers and actors strikes that pushed the show from September to January, Emmy organizers didn‚Äôt have to twist many arms to get people to take part.
‚ÄúPeople are happy to be back and happy to celebrate,‚Äù Harmon said. ‚ÄúIt is a monumental year.

"Need to follow consistent policy, focus on ‚ÄòMade in India‚Äô: FICCI EV panel chair amid Tesla bid",FICCI has also proposed to the government to cover small electric cars for incentives under the FAME scheme.,"The government should not dilute Make in India initiative and follow a consistent policy, Ficci EV Committee Chairperson Sulajja Firodia Motwani said amid a push from American electric carmaker Tesla for special sops to set up its factory in the country.
Motwani, the founder and CEO of Kinetic Green which sells battery-operated three-wheelers, scooters, e-cycles, and buggies, also emphasised creating a holistic ecosystem for the growth of the electric vehicle segment.
She also batted for the continuation of incentives for buying EVs to sustain the demand for the next few years.

Motwani also noted that the industry body is also pushing for the inclusion of electric cars priced up to Rs 20 lakh to get incentives under the third iteration of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) India scheme.

‚ÄúI strongly feel that the Make in India policies that the government has put in place, there should not be any reversal because now people have started investing in local manufacturing,‚Äù Motwani told PTI in an interaction.
If not followed diligently, the manufacturers would again shift to importing components from other countries including China, she added.
When asked if US carmaker Tesla should get policy support to enter the Indian market, Motwani said: ‚ÄúAs far as the entry of some of the premium car makers like Tesla goes I don‚Äôt know the details about the proposal but I believe it‚Äôs linked to a large investment..But I still feel personally there should not be confusion and the policy should be consistent.

People should know that there is a policy in place and it needs to be followed, she noted.

‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be that one day you say that Make in India is important..and then you say that now duties are reduced. Policy should be long-term and consistent,‚Äù Motwani said.
India should definitely focus on Make in India because that will only create long-term competitiveness, she noted.
‚ÄúOtherwise, we‚Äôll end up becoming a country where there are EV users but materials for their production are coming from other countries,‚Äù she added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Motwani said FICCI has also proposed to the government to cover small electric cars for incentives under the FAME scheme.
‚ÄúFICCI has already given its recommendations to the Heavy Industries ministry for the FAME 3 scheme and said that now we should also consider private cars because there is genuine interest in the public. We are proposing an incentive for cars up to Rs 20 lakh only,‚Äù she noted.
The FAME India scheme, originally introduced on April 1, 2019, currently caters to public and commercial transport in the segments of electric three-wheelers, electric four-wheelers and electric buses.
The benefit of the incentive is also available to privately owned registered electric two-wheelers (e-2W).

Motwani stated that till the time battery prices come down considerably there is a need to continue with demand incentives for the next 3-5 years.

She noted that the time is now ripe to have deeper inter-ministerial dialogue regarding the EV segment.
‚ÄúI think the time has come that we set up task forces in order to look at the next five years of ecosystem creation..assuming demand momentum is continued with demand incentives, then we need to also create an ecosystem with all the stakeholders involved,‚Äù Motwani said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/ev-policy-ficci-electric-vehicles-kinetic-green-9061945/,business

Meta‚Äôs Messenger app will no longer handle your SMS,It's time to switch to another app for SMS.,"Meta has announced that starting from September 28, 2023, Messenger will no longer support SMS. This means that Android users will not be able to choose it as their default SMS app.
One of the unique features of Android is that it allows users to switch their default messaging app, which is usually Google Messages, to another one. Messenger added the ability to receive SMS and MMS messages in 2016, offering a dual experience where users could chat with their Facebook friends and also send and receive text messages. The SMS threads were distinguished by a purple colour, while the regular online chats were blue.

"SS Rajamouli, a huge fan of Shruti Haasan, is disappointed with Prashanth Neel as Salaar has no dance numbers","SS Rajamouli, in a special interview with Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj, said he is disappointed that Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire will not have Shruti Haasan dancing.","Time and again, SS Rajamouli keeps proving that he is an out-and-out commercial filmmaker who strives to keep the audience entertained. While most filmmakers are moving past the concept of dance and item numbers in their films, the Baahubali director feels that people would miss it. In a special interview with Prashanth Neel, Prabhas, and Prithviraj, Rajamouli said that he is disappointed that Salaar doesn‚Äôt have a dance number.
Rajamouli said that he is a huge fan of Shruti Haasan‚Äôs dance and he keeps rewatching her songs on his phone and TV. Being such an ardent fan of her dance moves, Rajamouli is disappointed that Salaar Part 1: Ceasefire, which features Shruti in an important role, will not have a dance number. He said, ‚ÄúOne of the complaints that I have with Salaar is that‚Ä¶ two songs I watch on my phone or TV are her party song from Race Gurram and Charusheela from Srimanthudu. I just love her dancing. Out in the corridor, you were saying that there are no duets in Salaar. You disappointed me (laughs). Jokes apart, people will be expecting something as the two are in the film.‚Äù

‚ÄòWe‚Äôre probably the most well-rounded squad to tour India‚Äô: Nathan Lyon,"Steve Smith was heard encouraging a net bowler with a ""shabaash"" and David Warner turned down an extra round of throwdowns with ""nahi, nahi"", according to the website.","Experience and learning from past mistakes of previous tours, a more chilled vibe, calmer captain and a well-rounded, flexible squad could be the difference from all earlier times when Australians toured India.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre probably the most well-rounded squad to tour India,‚Äù Lyon was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au, on the eve of the first Test at Nagpur. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably more confident now than what I was in the past. We‚Äôve played a lot of cricket together ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre a really well-balanced team and we know what we want to set out to achieve,‚Äù he added of his third Test tour. ‚ÄúHe reckons it is their best chance of claiming the Border-Gavaskar Trophy abroad, something they have done just once in 54 years,‚Äù cricket.com.au wrote.
Familiarizing themselves with the ‚Äúrhythm of the subcontinent‚Äù happened at low-key Alur where a smattering of Hindi was heard. ‚ÄúIn some ways it‚Äôs been a low-key preparation,‚Äù Cummins told cricket.com.au. ‚ÄúIt means we‚Äôve hit plenty of balls, we‚Äôve done all the work, so once the game starts we‚Äôre ready. But we also haven‚Äôt spent all our energy before that.‚Äù
So, Usman Khawaja told a local net bowler in Hindi, with a Queensland twang, to bowl four straight balls to him (‚ÄúAur char ball seedha aap hi daalna‚Äù) and that he is bowling well (‚ÄúBahut achhe daal Rahe ho‚Äù, as per cricket.com.au. Khawaja would brush off a visa delay to a ‚Äúcountry he has been to 11 times without playing a Test.‚Äù
Steve Smith was heard encouraging a net bowler with a ‚Äúshabaash‚Äù and David Warner turned down an extra round of throwdowns with ‚Äúnahi, nahi‚Äù, according to the website.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely more learned,‚Äù Khawaja was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made so many mistakes in the past and at some level you learn from them. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee success but there‚Äôs definitely a different way of thinking. I remember we went to Sri Lanka a while back (in 2016), we struggled there. And even going back on that (last) Indian tour (in 2017), our game plan kind of changed from game to game.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a more mature side and realise that sometimes you can do all the right things but lose the game. That doesn‚Äôt mean that you shouldn‚Äôt do the same thing again the next game. Our batters are more mature, our bowlers are more mature, I think our coaching staff is pretty mature too. I think that helps.‚Äù
Big score needs to be really big
ADVERTISEMENT
Steve Smith was captain in 2017 and his takeaway from previous losses stems from ruefully recalling how his side failed to capitalise on winning the first Test in Pune. What haunts him as per the website was Ranchi, ‚Äúwhere the Aussies posted a seemingly strong total of 451 in the first innings. India declared on 9-601 and the tourists were forced to hold on grimly to avoid an innings defeat. It was a similar story for the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle last year when Australia‚Äôs first-innings 364 left them nearly 200 runs in deficit after the hosts then showed how true the pitch still was. If presented with another typical subcontinental track that initially favours batters and then takes turn later in the Test, Smith knows their sights need to be set higher.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf the wickets are good, I think it‚Äôs important to make really big scores,‚Äù he was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúI always think back to our Test match at Ranchi, we got 450 in the first innings and it wasn‚Äôt nearly enough. If the wickets are good, we‚Äôre going to have to make 550-plus to get ourselves in the game.‚Äù
Cummins on his third tour to Asia as captain, has learnt it‚Äôs more complicated than rotating quicks. ‚ÄúHere sometimes you‚Äôve got to wait for the conditions to come to you. If it‚Äôs flat on the first two days, but you know the back-end of the game it may break up, it‚Äôs as much about holding on, trying to keep control of the game those first few days. So it‚Äôs slightly different fields, putting some deeper men back.
‚ÄúOn the flipside, the game can happen really quickly. Batting, you‚Äôve got to have a plan from ball one. And in the field, it‚Äôs about trying to stay in that zone when it is happening really fast, and create different options.
ADVERTISEMENT
It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs different a lot of the time to what you get used to growing up playing in Australia.‚Äù
‚ÄúConfidence in own identity‚Äù
According to cricket.Com.au, Australia‚Äôs greatest asset might just be the confidence they have in their own identity. ‚ÄúThere was some merit in then-coach Justin Langer‚Äôs lament during the 2018-19 summer that ‚Äúwe‚Äôd be (seen as) the worst blokes in the world‚Äù if his side had mimicked Virat Kohli‚Äôs on-field antagonism. While this current iteration of the Australian team is less concerned with that side of the game than previous ones, they are perhaps more comfortable in pushing back than when they walked the post-Sandpaper gate tightrope.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs going to be little heated moments on the field,‚Äù Cummins was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs two passionate teams playing against each other. But I hope, like we‚Äôve shown over the last little bit, that we can manage our way through that.
‚ÄúIf there is a bit of spice and someone‚Äôs getting themselves pumped up, maybe that‚Äôs for that purpose, to get themselves into the contest at that moment.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really big on just concentrating on our own approach to the game. ‚Äú",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-we-were-probably-the-most-well-rounded-squad-to-tour-india-nathan-lyon-8433142/,sports

Shine Tom Chacko receives backlash for comments about Beast co-star Vijay‚Äôs salary,"Shine Tom Chacko pointed out that Vijay earns more than Mohanlal, Mammootty, and Kamal Haasan despite being not as talented as the legends.","Malayalam actor Shine Tom Chacko has yet again courted controversy with his comments. He earlier faced the brunt of Vijay fans for criticising his acting skills after working with him in the Tamil movie Beast. The actor has now compared Vijay‚Äôs acting skills with those of Mohanlal, Mammootty, and Kamal Haasan and said that Vijay is overpaid despite not being as good as the veterans. He explained that the salary is not about acting skills but just stardom.
In the interview, when asked about the gender pay disparity between Vijay and Nayanthara, Shine explained that the disparity is not just about gender but it goes beyond all aspects including acting skills. ‚ÄúHow much Vijay is getting paid? How much are Mammootty and Mohanlal getting paid? Is Vijay better than them? Is Vijay better than Kamal Haasan? So, it is not about skills.

India‚Äôs economy to hold top spot for GDP but not so much for jobs growth: Poll,"Adani, at the company's AGM a few days back, stated, ""Of the several projects underway, two of the key ones include the Navi Mumbai Airport and the Copper Smelter, and both are on schedule"".","Billionaire Gautam Adani-led group‚Äôs copper-producing factory at Mundra in Gujarat will start operations from March next year, helping cut India‚Äôs dependence on imports and aiding energy transition, sources said.
Copper is known as the ‚Äúmetal of electrification‚Äù as deeper electrification requires wires, which are primarily made from copper. Technologies critical to the energy transition like electric vehicles (EVs), charging infrastructure, solar photovoltaics (PV), wind and batteries, all require copper.
Kutch Copper Ltd (KCL), a subsidiary of the group‚Äôs flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL), is setting up a greenfield copper refinery project for the production of refined copper with 1 million tonnes per annum in two phases.
ADVERTISEMENT
For Phase-1, capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per annum, KCL has achieved financial closure through a syndicated club loan, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The first phase is expected to become operational by the end of the current fiscal, they said.
Adani, at the company‚Äôs AGM a few days back, stated, ‚ÄúOf the several projects underway, two of the key ones include the Navi Mumbai Airport and the Copper Smelter, and both are on schedule‚Äù.
The Rs 8,783 crore-greenfield project completed a full debt tie-up with a consortium of banks led by SBI earlier this year, they said, adding the entire debt requirement of Rs 6,071 crore for Phase-1 has been provided by the consortium of banks.
ADVERTISEMENT
The equity for the project has been invested by the parent Adani Enterprises Ltd. In addition, it has got all the major approvals in place to ensure timely execution.
Copper is the third most used industrial metal after steel and aluminium, and its demand is rising on the back of fast-growing renewable energy, telecom and electric vehicle industries.
India‚Äôs copper production has been unable to meet this demand, and domestic supply disruptions have led to a higher dependency on imported copper. India‚Äôs imports have been consistently on the rise for the past five years.
ADVERTISEMENT
For FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023 fiscal), India imported a record 1,81,000 tonnes of copper, while exports plummeted to a record low of 30,000 tonnes, even lower than the pandemic period, according to the data from the government.
The country is estimated to have consumed 7,50,000 tonnes of copper in FY23 (612 KT in FY22). The number is expected to rise to 1.7 million tonnes by 2027 on the back of huge demand from the green energy industry.
Global demand for copper from solar photovoltaic (PV) installations alone is estimated to double to 2.25 million tonnes in the current decade.
Adani group, which is rapidly growing its renewable portfolio, will be a significant consumer of the red metal, sources said.
The strategically located plant at Mundra on the west coast will play a crucial part in the green energy infrastructure development, and encourage ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô. The project has the potential to make the Mundra Special Economic Zone a hub for downstream ecosystems of value-added copper products going forward.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sources said the location provides the additional advantage of access to lower cost and uninterrupted energy supply and logistical infrastructure to cater to domestic and international demand.
On the operational front, the company is engaged in long-term supply agreements for the key raw material ‚Äî copper concentrate. This, along with strategic location and integrated value chain advantage, will help Kutch Copper to be one of the most sustainable and lowest-cost copper producers in the world, according to sources.
ADVERTISEMENT
Keeping in mind the group‚Äôs ESG priorities, the plant‚Äôs sustainable solution-based project design will have zero liquid discharge. It will explore using green power and deploying byproducts for cement and other businesses.
In addition, the plant will be producing 25 tonnes per annum old, 250 tonnes of silver and 1,500 kilotonnes per annum (KTPA) sulphuric acid and 250 KTPA phosphoric acid as byproducts.
ADVERTISEMENT
India imports roughly two million tonnes of sulphuric acid, which is a key raw material for manufacturing phosphatic fertilisers, detergents and speciality chemicals.
Globally, copper production is more concentrated than oil. The two top producers ‚Äì Chile and Peru ‚Äì account for 38 per cent of world production.
Demand growth during the energy transition ‚Äì moving away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy ‚Äì is projected to be pronounced in the US, China and Europe, besides India. By 2035, the US is projected to import up to two-thirds of its copper needs.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/adani-group-1-billion-copper-project-mudra-march-2024-8856865/,business

‚ÄòShah Rukh Khan and I were never close friends‚Äô: Manoj Bajpayee says he doesn‚Äôt cross paths with SRK any more,Manoj Bajpayee and Shah Rukh Khan trained under acting coach Barry John in New Delhi before they became leading actors in Bollywood.,"Actors Manoj Bajpayee and Shah Rukh Khan can trace their origins to the same acting group in Delhi, but the two chose very different styles of cinema as their careers progressed.

He said that their worlds are so different now that the two of them don‚Äôt even bump into each other anymore.

The purchasing managers‚Äô index, or PMI, fell to 49.5 in October on a 100-point scale, down from 50.2 last month, according to the National Bureau of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.
A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity while a number above 50 reflects an expansion. The non-manufacturing PMI for October fell 1.1 percentage points to 50.6, a sign of slowing activity in China‚Äôs service and construction industries.

Factory output and supplier delivery times improved while measures of new orders, raw materials and employment contracted.
China‚Äôs recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has faltered after an initial burst of growth earlier in the year faded more quickly than expected.
In recent months, the government has raised spending on building ports and other infrastructure, cut interest rates and eased curbs on home-buying. But economists say wider reforms are needed to address long-term problems that are stifling growth.
‚ÄúIf reflected in hard activity data, today‚Äôs PMIs suggest that the momentum of China‚Äôs economic growth ebbed at the beginning of the fourth quarter,‚Äù Robert Carnell, regional head of research for ING Economics in Asia Pacific, said in a report.

Carnell said support measures, including increased government spending, will help offset any tendency for the economy to slow.

Meredith Whittaker, the President of the Signal Foundation ‚Äì which runs the eponymous messaging app ‚Äì said that privacy is about power asymmetries, with governments and corporations trying to leverage intimate information they have about people. The messaging app is supported by the Signal Foundation, which relies on donations made by users for funds.

Edited excerpts:
We finally had a data protection law some weeks ago, but despite that, you see the notion of privacy having varying explanations in our society. Some say it is perhaps an elitist right, in that only the well to do people care about it. The reality is also that despite being the biggest democracy online, there are households where one digital device is shared by adults of different genders, and kids. How do you view India as a market for an app that‚Äôs solely focused on offering private communications?

"Amanjot Kaur story: Carpenter father hand-crafted her first bat, now she plays for India","Taunted for choosing ‚Äúboy sport‚Äù, she overcomes stereotypes and setbacks with love and support of father.","One evening when Amanjot Kaur was playing cricket in the nearby gully, with the boys in the neighbourhood, they refused to let her bat. The reason they told her: ‚ÄúShe did not have a bat.‚Äù The real reason was different, only a few days ago had she hit a boy for boundaries, before she repeated it again. It had wound up the boys.
She returned home and instead of warmly hugging her father, a routine, she spent the evening idle. Bhupinder Singh, a carpenter, sensed something was wrong. Later, she told her about the evening, and he immediately started his scooter, went to his shop and returned late in the night with a wooden bat he himself had carved. He put the bat next to her and left home early for duty.

IND vs AFG: Double Super Overs dhamaka seals a tense India-Afghanistan T20 game,"The Afghans would have felt ahead of the game when they restricted India for 11 in the next Super Over, before leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi got two wickets in three balls to bring a manic evening to an end.","It was an inconsequential match ‚Äì both in terms of the outcome of the series as well as the composition of the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup. It was the last international game India played in the format before the global showpiece event, but with the IPL coming up in a couple of months, nothing really hinged on this game.
But the drama and length of the game ‚Äì a T20 game running almost four and a half hours with two sets of Super Overs ‚Äì was akin to a match with much more riding on it. There were batsmen taking extra runs despite a throw deflecting of their body, a batsman of Rohit Sharma‚Äôs pedigree retiring himself out to get in a faster runner between wickets, and tempers being frayed between India and Afghanistan ‚Äì two teams that generally get along quite well; the game was one crazy exhibition of the format.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/double-super-overs-seals-a-tense-india-afghanistan-t20-game-9114543/,sports

"Sensex tanks 505 points, Nifty closes lower at 19,330 on profit-taking after record rally","The Mumbai-based, Wadia group airline, which filed for voluntary insolvency, blamed P&W for the same stating that the US-based engine maker refused to comply with an award issued by the emergency arbitrator earlier.","In what can be seen as a relief for grounded airline Go First, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has directed aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney (P&W) to release and dispatch five engines every month to the carrier starting August 1 until December 31.
Go First, which is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings, stopped commercial operations since May 3. The Mumbai-based, Wadia group airline, which filed for voluntary insolvency, blamed P&W for the same stating that the US-based engine maker refused to comply with an award issued by the emergency arbitrator earlier.
‚ÄúThe respondent (P&W) must take all reasonable steps to release and dispatch to the claimant (Go First), without delay as they become available, five engines per month immediately after any engine becomes available and commencing, at latest, on 1 August 2023 and continuing through December 31 2023, subject to further orders of this tribunal,‚Äù the tribunal said in its order.
ADVERTISEMENT
The development comes as a relief for Go First because it is trying to resume operations and has approached the Directorate General of Civil Aviation for approval. The airline has sought an interim funding of around Rs 450 crore from banks, for which the committee of creditors has given an in-principle approval.
The tribunal further added that the order does not apply to any third-party engines that are in the MRO process, as to which the engine lessors have communicated contrary disposition directions based on their pre-moratorium termination of leases with Go First.
A P&W spokesperson said: ‚ÄúPratt & Whitney respects the interim application ruling and will comply with the order until it is otherwise modified. We look forward to vigorously defending ourselves during the merits proceedings where the business and legal issues will be determined and resolved‚Äù.
Earlier, in an interim order delivered in March, SIAC had directed P&W to dispatch at least 10 serviceable spare leased engines by April 27, 2023 and a further 10 spare leased engines per month until December 2023.

Sandeep Reddy Vanga says he didn‚Äôt take controversy around ‚Äònon-consensual kiss‚Äô in Kabir Singh ‚Äòseriously‚Äô,"Sandeep Reddy Vanga stressed that Kabir Singh isn't a misogynistic movie, and suggested that the controversy around it erupted because of only four or five people.","Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga appeared to be in no mood to discuss the criticisms leveled against his last film, Kabir Singh, as he prepares to deliver the biggest hit of his short career with Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor. Kabir Singh divided audiences, with a section of viewers calling out its glorification of toxic masculinity. But it emerged as a massive hit, grossing nearly Rs 400 crore worldwide.
In an interview with CNN-News18, Vanga was asked about a non-consensual kiss between Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani‚Äôs characters in that film, and said that he doesn‚Äôt take the controversy around it ‚Äòseriously‚Äô. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think much about it. I don‚Äôt think that Kabir Singh was a misogynistic film. Only four-five people felt offended, and created noise about it. I never took them seriously,‚Äù he said.

When he was told that it was more than just a handful of people who found fault with the film, Vanga added, ‚ÄúFour people wrote articles about it, and that inspired others to write more articles. Not more than 20 people in total, it was their point-of-view. We should not talk about all that, bhool jao Kabir Singh ko (forget Kabir Singh).‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
Both Shahid and Kiara have also defended Kabir Singh against criticism. In a chat with mid-day, Shahid called the movie ‚Äòa dysfunctional love story between a very simple girl and a very talented, brilliant, aggressive disturbed, guy‚Äô. Kiara told Bollywood Hungama, ‚ÄúMy opinion has always been very clear and for me deep down it‚Äôs a love story and the thing about love is that it‚Äôs the only thing that will allow you to forgive certain behaviours in life. Relationships are very complex and it‚Äôs very easy for a third person to say ‚Äòget out of that relationship‚Äô. But for two people in that relationship, it is another complication altogether.‚Äù
A kiss between Ranbir Kapoor and Rashmika Mandanna‚Äôs characters in Animal, which seemed like Vanga‚Äôs answer to the Kabir Singh controversy, also generated conversation. The characters kiss each other as a sign of protest against their families, who disapprove of their relationship. Animal is expected to deliver massive numbers at the box office, and is currently aiming for more than Rs 100 crore globally on day one of release.

The unintended similarities between Bobby Deol‚Äôs Soldier and Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs Jawan: How much has Hindi cinema really changed?,"As Bobby Deol's Soldier turns 25 this week, we draw parallels between the film and Shah Rukh Khan's recent blockbuster Jawan and ask the pressing question: Is Hindi cinema truly progressing or circling back to familiar tropes?","I was looking for a subtle way to say this, but since the recent action thrillers in the Hindi cinema have been anything but subtle, I will put it plainly: Jawan gave me a headache. Too harsh? Hear me out. Jawan paraded a familiar narrative: a villain named Kalee (Vijay Sethupathi), a global arms dealer, a son (Azad, played by Shah Rukh Khan) seeking retribution for his supposedly deceased father (Vikram Rathore, also portrayed by SRK), unjustly branded a traitor to the nation. Meanwhile, the son‚Äôs grieving mother (Deepika Padukone) faces society‚Äôs harsh judgment. This film was a concoction of patriotism and on-the-nose messaging, essentially wrapping an outdated ‚Äô90s storyline in the sheen of modernity ‚Äîhigh-tech slow-motion shots, sleek cinematography, and sophisticated graphics ‚Äî served up for the 2023 audience.
Don‚Äôt believe me? I recently got a chance to watch Bobby Deol‚Äôs Soldier, the 1998 action thriller, that reminded me a lot of Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs Jawan. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this week, Soldier features Bobby Deol as Vicky, the son of a deceased Army officer, embarking on a vendetta to avenge his father, falsely accused of treachery. His ostracised mother seeks solace in a temple, shunned by society. The film‚Äôs antagonists are responsible for slandering Vicky‚Äôs father, in the same way that Kalee besmirched Azad‚Äôs father, Vikram Rathore, in Jawan.

Fed‚Äôs Powell: Not yet clear rates are high enough to control inflation,His remarks showed the Fed wrestling with conflicting signals from an economy where inflation has by some readings slowed a lot without much cost to the economy.,"The U.S. Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates further to ensure inflation is contained Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday in remarks that balanced declines in the pace of price increases over the past year with the surprising overperformance of the U.S. economy.
Powell said Fed policymakers would ‚Äúproceed carefully as we decide whether to tighten further,‚Äù but also made clear that the central bank has not yet concluded that its benchmark interest rate is high enough to be sure that inflation returns to the 2% target.
‚ÄúIt is the Fed‚Äôs job to bring inflation down to our 2% goal, and we will do so,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúWe have tightened policy significantly over the past year. Although inflation has moved down from its peak ‚Äî a welcome development ‚Äî it remains too high. We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective.‚Äù

In that context, recent data has raised a new concern, he said.
‚ÄúWe are attentive to signs that the economy may not be cooling as expected,‚Äù with consumer spending ‚Äúespecially robust‚Äù and the housing sector possibly rebounding, Powell said.
The economy continues to grow above trend, Powell said, and if that continues ‚Äúit could put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.‚Äù
His remarks showed the Fed wrestling with conflicting signals from an economy where inflation has by some readings slowed a lot without much cost to the economy ‚Äî a good outcome, but one that has raised the possibility that Fed policy is not restrictive enough to complete the job.

It was difficult, he said, to know with precision the degree to which the Fed‚Äôs current 5.25% to 5.5% benchmark interest rate had cleared the ‚Äúneutral‚Äù rate of interest needed to slow the economy, and therefore hard to assess just where policy stands.
Powell repeated what has become a standard Fed diagnosis of inflation progress ‚Äî with a pandemic-era jump in goods inflation easing and a decline in housing inflation ‚Äúin the pipeline,‚Äù but concern that continued consumer spending on a broad array of services and a tight labor market may make a return to 2% difficult.
A recent decline in measures of underlying inflation, stripped of food and energy prices, ‚Äúwere welcome, but two months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence that inflation is moving down sustainably,‚Äù Powell said.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúGiven the size‚Äù of the broader services sector, excluding housing, ‚Äúsome further progress will be essential,‚Äù the Fed chief said, and it will likely require an economic slowdown to deliver it.
‚ÄúRestrictive monetary policy will likely play an increasingly important role. Getting inflation sustainably back down to 2% is expected to require a period of below-trend economic growth as well as some softening in labor market conditions,‚Äù Powell said.
‚ÄúTwo percent is and will remain our inflation target,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúWe are committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to that level over time.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/fed-powell-rates-high-control-inflation-8909544/,business

Run machine Smith wins fourth Allan Border medal,"Smith polled 171 votes, while nearest rival Travis Head managed 144, to claim Australian cricket's greatest individual honour which he had previously won in 2015, 2018 and 2021.","Australia run machine Steve Smith clinched his fourth Allan Border Medal on Monday, becoming only the third player, after Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke, to achieve the feat.
Smith polled 171 votes, while nearest rival Travis Head managed 144, to claim Australian cricket‚Äôs greatest individual honour which he had previously won in 2015, 2018 and 2021.
Former captain Smith racked up 1,524 runs, which included four hundreds, during the voting period and was crucial to Australia‚Äôs rise to number one in the test rankings.
Such was his domination in the two other formats that it did not matter in the end that Smith did not poll a single vote in the T20 Internationals.
Smith will be one of Australia‚Äôs key figures as they embark on a four-test tour in India where they hope to secure their place in the final of the World Test Championship.
The 33-year-old has been in strong form in 50-overs cricket too and famously quipped ‚ÄúI‚Äôm back, baby‚Äù during an ODI against England in November after a successful technique tweak.
He, however, lost the men‚Äôs ODI player of the year award to David Warner on countback, while Marcus Stoinis won the T20 honours ahead of Josh Hazlewood.

Opener Usman Khawaja claimed the Shane Warne award for the men‚Äôs test player of the year after a prolific 12 months during which he scored 1,020 at an average of 78.46.

"India‚Äôs oil imports set to hit 8-month low in July as rains, refinery maintenance affect demand","The US economy likely maintained a moderate pace of growth in the second quarter as labor market resilience underpinned consumer spending, while businesses boosted investment in equipment and built more factories, potentially keeping a much-feared recession at bay.","The U.S. economy likely maintained a moderate pace of growth in the second quarter as labor market resilience underpinned consumer spending, while businesses boosted investment in equipment and built more factories, potentially keeping a much-feared recession at bay.
The Commerce Department‚Äôs snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday is also expected to show the housing market slump nearing an end. Outside the housing market and manufacturing, the economy has largely weathered the 525 basis points in interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve since March 2022 as the U.S. central bank battled inflation.
Economists have since late 2022 been forecasting a downturn, but with price pressures retreating, some now believe that the soft-landing scenario for the economy envisaged by the Fed is feasible. The central bank on Wednesday raised its policy by 25 basis points to a 5.25%-5.50% range.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThis will be another indication that the economy is not tipping into recession. Much of the effect of the rate hikes already has occurred,‚Äù said Dean Maki, the chief economist at Point72 Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut. ‚ÄúAs long as the Fed is content that inflation is moderating at a fast enough pace, they‚Äôre not going to implement the kind of additional rate hikes that would be needed to bring about a recession.‚Äù
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP growth likely increased at a 1.8% annualized rate last quarter after rising at a 2.0% pace in the first quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, likely remained a pillar of support, although the pace of growth slowed from the second quarter‚Äôs robust 4.2% rate. Spending on long-lasting manufactured goods has slowed after booming during the COVID-19 pandemic. Services spending is, however, taking up some of the slack.
Spending is being propped up by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic, estimated by economists to be as much as $2.1 trillion at one point, debt and strong wage gains from the tight labor market as companies hoard workers after struggling to find labor during the pandemic. That is underscored by persistently low levels of layoffs.
ADVERTISEMENT
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday is likely to show first-time applications for state unemployment benefits rising 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended July 22, according to a Reuters poll.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, is seen falling to 1.750 million during the week ending July 15 from 1.754 million in the prior week. This covered the week that the government surveyed households for July‚Äôs unemployment rate. At 3.6% in June, the jobless rate was not too far from multi-decade lows.
‚ÄúThere are some pockets of job losses being announced here and there, but it does appear that people are getting jobs rather quickly if they are losing their jobs,‚Äù said Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at Truist Advisory Services in Atlanta.
FACTORY CONSTRUCTION BOOMING
ADVERTISEMENT
Business investment likely accelerated after almost stalling in the first quarter, thanks to an anticipated rebound in spending on equipment like aircraft and motor vehicles.
Efforts by President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States are boosting factory construction. Investment in nonresidential structures like factories probably remained robust last quarter, contributing to the economy‚Äôs resilience.
Further contribution to GDP growth was expected from government spending. Trade was likely a drag after adding to growth for four straight quarters.
Inventory investment is a wild card, though most economists are penciling in a contribution to GDP growth of at least five tenths of a percentage point. Business sharply reduced inventory accumulation in the January-March quarter in anticipation of weaker domestic demand, slicing 2.14 percentage points off GDP growth that period.
Though residential investment, which includes homebuilding, likely contracted for the ninth straight quarter, the decline was probably the shallowest in 1-1/2 years.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the past, when the economy was heading into recession, homebuilding and auto production plunged. But these cyclical parts of the economy, including new home sales and auto sales are picking up, raising cautious optimism that the economy could skirt a recession, even as some analysts expected GDP to turn negative at some point.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see some slowing in the second half of the year, and possibly negative GDP in the first quarter,‚Äù said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida‚Äôs Institute for Economic Forecasting. ‚ÄúBut will it rise to the level of a recession? That‚Äôs less clear.‚Äù
But some economists remain convinced that a recession is on the horizon, arguing that higher borrowing costs will eventually make it harder for consumers to fund their spending with debt.
ADVERTISEMENT
They also noted that banks were tightening credit and excess savings continued to be run down. Slowing job growth was seen curbing wage gains.
‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve been used to in the last couple of downturns is that everything kind of turns down at the same time,‚Äù said Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair in London.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different this time is that we‚Äôre just seeing a slowdown that‚Äôs being driven by the Fed. Over time rates are going to increasingly bite and the chances of a recession are higher than not having one.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/moderate-us-economic-growth-expected-in-second-quarter-8862632/,business

Ben Stokes‚Äôs shaky knee to cloud England‚Äôs Ashes buildup,"While Stokes had no regrets about enforcing the follow-on in the one-run defeat in Wellington, he had plenty about the state of his left knee which had him grimacing in pain throughout the drawn two-test series.","England head home from New Zealand with the rare sting of defeat after the Black Caps‚Äô ‚ÄòMiracle at the Basin‚Äô and more than a little concern over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes a few months out from the Ashes.
While Stokes had no regrets about enforcing the follow-on in the one-run defeat in Wellington, he had plenty about the state of his left knee which had him grimacing in pain throughout the drawn two-test series.
Knee trouble has long bothered Stokes but he has soldiered on through 10 test wins in 12 matches since taking charge of England last year.
Things appeared to have come to a head in Wellington, though, where the all-rounder managed to bowl only two overs and was in all sorts of bother when batting despite making 60 runs.
A reliable wicket-taker who often makes things happen with the ball, Stokes‚Äô seam bowling was not needed in the first innings as New Zealand were bundled out for 209.
However, England‚Äôs bowlers might have yearned for their captain‚Äôs support after he enforced the follow-on and put them in the field again.
New Zealand went on to rack up 483 against them as they tired and set a chase that England fell just short of.

Rather than rest up for the three-and-a-half months before the Ashes, Stokes will be heading to the Indian Premier League (IPL) starting March 31 to fulfil his $2 million deal with the Chennai Super Kings.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan called on Stokes to forgo the IPL to boost his chances of being fully fit for the Ashes which start in Birmingham on June 16.
Stokes wasn‚Äôt having it.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working hard with the physios and the medics out here to try to get myself into a place where I can fill that (bowling) role like how I have done the last 10 years or however long it is,‚Äù he said in Wellington.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a four-month period now to get it, sort of, even better before that Ashes because I want to be turning up in Birmingham being able to fill that role properly.‚Äù

It was unclear exactly what his injury was. Television cameras also caught him rubbing the back of his left thigh as he walked to the dressing room.
PSG coach Christophe Galtier told broadcaster Canal Plus ‚Äúhe took a blow behind the knee,‚Äù and then said at his news conference the injury does not appear serious.
‚ÄúIs it a bruise? We don‚Äôt know yet. It doesn‚Äôt look very serious,‚Äù Galtier said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not too worried.‚Äù

The Argentina star Messi tucked home PSG‚Äôs second goal with a typically neat finish in the 72nd after being set up by Fabi√°n Ruiz, who put PSG ahead in the 55th.
Striker Arnaud Nordin pulled one back in the 89th and, with the home team pushing forward, 16-year-old substitute Warren Za√Øre-Emery drove the ball home for 3-1 in stoppage time with his first goal for the club.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my first goal in the first division, so I‚Äôm very happy,‚Äù Za√Øre-Emery said after becoming PSG‚Äôs youngest scorer. The midfielder turns 17 in March.

"Are Australian universities setting campus in India charging more for same courses? Check fees, facilities","While the tuition fees is almost the same, students will be taught by international faculty at some Australian universities setting up campus in India.","After the government‚Äôs nod, as of now, two Australian universities ‚Äî the University of Wollongong and Deakin University ‚Äî have confirmed and started the process of setting up their campuses in India.
Deakin University has recently announced applications for the Master of Business Analytics and Master of Cyber Security (Professional) programmes, which will begin in July 2024. For this course, students will have to pay an annual fee of about AUD 19,000 (Rs 10 lakh). The varsity will also offer postgraduate courses in Cybersecurity and Business Analytics.
On the other hand, the University of Wollongong India will offer a Graduate Certificate in Computing and Master of Computing (Data Analytics), followed by further undergraduate programmes in 2025. Student fees will be set at 50 per cent of those incurred by international students studying at UOW‚Äôs Australian campuses. Students are usually asked to pay around AUD 18,000 (Rs 9.9 lakh).

To draw a comparison, in India, the fee for an MBA from one of the top management colleges of India, the Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore (IIM-B) costs nearly Rs 24.50 lakh (for two years). This fees covers tuition, library, internet, case permission royalty, course material, hostel room rent, service charge, medical insurance, personal accident insurance and alumni activity. However, it excludes Service Tax and any other tax. Such taxes, if made applicable by law, will be collected from students at the prescribed rates. Additionally, students will have to pay mess advance of Rs 30,000 each term.

In IIM Ranchi, the fee for MBA, MBA-HR and MBA-BA programme for the batch 2023-25 will be Rs 17.2 lakh (excluding caution deposit, alumni fee and mess expense). Similarly, at IIM Calcutta, the fee for a similar PG course ‚Äî Post Graduate Diploma In Business Analytics ‚Äî is Rs 25 lakh. This does not include caution money, food-related expenses, lodging and any travel expenses that the students may incur in the fourth semester when they visit any industrial location.
While these are government colleges, even the Indian private business schools don‚Äôt cost as much as these international campuses. The Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur which ranked at ninth position in NIRF Management rankings 2023 charges nearly Rs 9.90 lakh for the first year of MBA-BM course, and Rs 9.40 lakh for the second year.

The perks of paying more in the Indian campuses of these Australian universities, however, is that there will be opportunities for students to study a semester at the main Wollongong campus or other UOW offshore campuses in Dubai, Hong Kong, or Malaysia.
A similar trend will be followed for Deakin University. ‚ÄúAll of the programmes can be delivered in India, but because the programme is delivered with an identical curriculum and a teaching period structure that is the same as we offer in Australia, it means that should they wish to spend one of those three teaching periods in Australia they could absolutely do that. We don‚Äôt anticipate that many will want to do that, because I think if you wanted to come to Australia, you‚Äôd probably be coming to Australia, but the option is there, and it‚Äôs lined up to be able to do that,‚Äù said Prof Iain Martin, Vice Chancellor of Deakin University.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/are-australian-universities-setting-campus-in-india-charging-more-for-same-courses-check-fees-facilities-9052758/,education

MPC meeting: RBI leaves repo rate unchanged at 6.5%,"Unveiling the bi-monthly monetary policy review, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das said the domestic economy exhibits resilience on the back of strong demand.","IN LINE with market expectations, the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) left its key interest rate unchanged for the fourth time in a row on Friday, even as it flagged retail inflation as a ‚Äúmajor risk to macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth‚Äù.
The RBI‚Äôs decision to keep the repo rate ‚Äî the rate at which the RBI lends money to banks to meet their short-term funding needs ‚Äî unchanged at 6.5 per cent will mean that all external  benchmark lending rates (EBLR) linked to the repo rate will not rise.

"Jawan VFX breakdown video reveals Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs computer-generated cigar, how the epic highway chase was created",Fans of Jawan were very impressed with the visual effects that went into creating the film. Red Chillies VFX revealed of its secrets behind the digital magic tricks witnessed in the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer.,"Red Chillies VFX has shared a video breakdown of the visual effects work that went into last year‚Äôs biggest Indian film, the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan. Directed by Atlee, the vigilante action film went on to gross over Rs 1100 crore globally, emerging as the most successful film of SRK‚Äôs career. Jawan told the story of a vigilante police officer who leads a team of female prisoners in carrying out socially conscious heists. Along the way, he reunites with his father, also played by SRK.
The three-minute VFX breakdown provides insight into several key moments from the film, revealing that the exterior of the metro train in the opening sequence was entirely computer-generated. The prison where a lot of the film‚Äôs action takes place was partially constructed, but enhanced through visual effects. The cottage where Vikram Rathore lived with his wife, played by Deepika Padukone, was created entirely with the help of visual effects. One of the most interesting details revealed in the breakdown video is that the cigar that Vikram smokes in the film was computer-generated, at least in the one shot shown in the video.

"Saturn will lose its rings. Long before that, they will turn invisible to us","Saturn is set to lose its characteristic rings but that will take a long time as far as humans are concerned. But in 2023, those very rings could become invisible to us.","The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2018 confirmed that Saturn is losing its rings at a rapid pace. The planet‚Äôs gravity is pulling in enough ice from the rings to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in half an hour. Even though it will take a long time for the rings to disappear completely, they are soon going to be invisible to us here on Earth.
An optical illusion
Galileo was the first person to observe Saturn‚Äôs beautiful rings in 1610 when he turned his 20x telescope towards the planet named after the Roman god of agriculture. Right now, anyone with basic astronomy gear can turn their equipment towards the planet to catch a glimpse of the rings that are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock.

"A couple of holes in my shoes with few legs sticking in, says Neil Wagner about team huddle after New Zealand beat England by 1 run","Left-arm fast bowler took four crucial wickets - Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, and last man James Anderson just when the second Test seemed to be slipping away from New Zealand's grasp","NZ vs ENG: As the delirious with joy New Zealand players ran and jumped over each other before forming a huddle to celebrate the famous one-run win over England in Wellington, fast bowler Neil Wagner was the hero of the moment. Four wickets, including that of Ollie Pope, Ben Stokes, Joe Root and last man James Anderson, were priceless and he was also quick on the field taking two smart catches.
‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs nail fish-hook in my face‚Ä¶ a couple of holes in my shoes with few legs sticking in ‚Ä¶ these are the moments that stay with life forever ‚Äì not 5 wickets or whatever,‚Äù Wagner said when asked about the celebrations within the huddle.
New Zealand, after being made to follow-on, had posted 483 and gave England a 258-run target.
For all his effort with the ball, Wagner came very close to handing England the win.
New Zealand‚Äôs Neil Wagner, left, and teammate Matt Henry embrace after New Zealand won by 1 run on day 5 of their cricket test match against England in Wellington, New Zealand, Tuesday, Feb 28, 2023. (Andrew Cornaga/Photosport via AP)
In what was to be the second last ball of the second Test, left-arm quick Wagner bowled short down the leg-side to last man James Anderson. England, riding high on their Bazball philosophy, needed two to win at that point. If the ball had been called a ‚Äòwide‚Äô the scores would have been tied. But it was not to be and the second Test at Wellington hung in the balance.
Four overs earlier it was Wagner who took a tumbling catch at fine leg to dismiss the last recognised batsman Ben Foakes who had skied his pull shot to Tim Southee. But Anderson and Jack Leach had survived and England were just a couple of runs away from sweeping the two match series 0-2. Anderson had even swung to find a four in Wagner‚Äôs previous over.
But Wagner would have the last laugh. His hard lengths and deceptively good short balls are always a handful. Here he was really steaming in and bending his back to get the ball to rise. The ball to dismiss Anderson wasn‚Äôt the best though. Short and once again more leg-side, the England fast bowler could have let it go. But Anderson‚Äôs feeble attempt to play it to fine leg as the ball was rising towards his hips ended up in the hands of diving wicketkeeper Tom Blundell. A little more bat on it and the ball would have headed to the boundary. But New Zealand had pulled off a famous win; the first time a team following on had won a Test since India‚Äôs famous win over Australia at Eden Gardens.

‚ÄúToo much went through my head. Gosh! All the things that go at the top of the mark. What ball to bowl, they needed 2 runs. Should I pitch it and be at his stumps? You just stick to your guns. Keep thinking about getting that glove or catches in play. It just came off. Great character from the team to keep fighting,‚Äù Wagner said after pulling off the tense win.

It was Wagner who also struck major blows during England‚Äôs run chase when he dismissed the well-set Joe Root for 95 after getting rid of England captain Ben Stokes. Root was surprised by the rising trajectory of the ball and was caught at mid-wicket, Stokes tried to dispatch Wagner to the boundary but was caught too.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about summing up the conditions . There is a period where you go at him, take risks, and see if you can do this (bouncing at Stokes) ‚Äì and buy a wicket. They needed runs, they also know they can get out. When you get wickets, it makes it hard for the next guy to start. It‚Äôs about summing up the conditions,‚Äù Wagner said about dismissing Stokes and Root in successive overs. Stokes and Root had added 121 runs for the sixth wicket and till they were at the crease, England looked in control.
When Anderson had hit a welcome boundary off Wagner in the 73rd over with England needing just six to win, it looked like this could be another win for the Bazball brand of cricket. Wagner said he felt the game had slipped away at that point.
‚ÄúI thought that was the game. I was going for his gloves and the last thing I expected him to do was backing away and getting a big hit at it. And going between Williamson‚Äôs legs is not something you see. Especially in the over prior, one edge flew over Blundell (the wicketkeeper). You start thinking, whether that‚Äôs it, is this the game?.‚Äù

Kane Williamson who made a back against the ball century when they were following on called it a ‚Äòfantastic game‚Äô.
‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt quite feel right to be standing here, after a game of cricket like that and the contributions we‚Äôve seen from both teams throughout. A fantastic game of cricket to be a part of and, for us as a team, we‚Äôve been fighting away in the test format for a while so it‚Äôs nice to get across the line on this one. This England team is playing incredible cricket at the moment and we‚Äôre up against it, coming into this game. So to fight away and compete and ultimately just get across the line is a really nice feeling,‚Äù Williamson said.

England skipper Stokes said that he and Root should have taken the team home.
‚ÄúThat game is what Test cricket is about, the emotions we were going through and the Kiwi boys as well. Everyone‚Äôs got their money‚Äôs worth today. We knew that at some point Tim would have to roll the dice. For Joe and myself, that was the opportunity to pounce, and sometimes things don‚Äôt happen how you want them to. With bouncer plans, you have to make a decision about what to go to.

SA vs IND: Aiden Markram leaves self-doubts behind for counter-attacking century,"Choosing his end to attack, never dropping the bat below the waist, South African opener plays with assured footwork to score memorable 106 off 103 balls on devilish track.","There are two Aiden Markrams out there. India has usually brought out the vulnerable one. The fragile version had the ‚Äúbiggest relief‚Äù, according to his long-time mentor Pierre de Bruyn, when Dean Elgar and then Temba Bavuma were made Test captains. It was against India when Markram, just 23 and playing just his third ODI, was made the captain in a ODI series in 2018 and the ‚Äúnext Graeme Smith‚Äù collapsed under pressure. In a series where India crushed South Africa 5-1, Markram was so distressed that he didn‚Äôt even remember the manner of his dismissal in the final ODI at Port Elizabeth in his post-game chat with an alarmed de Bruyn. A year later, during another nightmarish series in India, after he got out to twin ducks in the Pune Test, he punched a ‚Äúsolid object‚Äù in the dressing room and left the tour with a fractured wrist. He would soon be dropped from the team.
‚ÄúWhat we saw in Pune was as a build-up, a ticking time bomb,‚Äù de Bruyn had told this newspaper. ‚ÄúIt was a frustrating tour for him, and the whole captaincy thing that was placed on his shoulders before‚Ä¶ That is not Aiden, to go into a change room and hit the cupboard. When that incident happened, I was worried.‚Äù

Neliima Azeem recalls when a three-and-a-half year old Ishaan confronted a man who was being ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô with her: ‚ÄòHe said should I call the police?‚Äô,"Neliima Azeem recalled the time when her kids, Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter, were really young but were very protective of their mother.","Neliima Azeem, who is the mother of actors Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter, brought up her sons almost single-handedly and the actor-dancer is very proud of the way her kids have grown up to be confident and responsible adults. Both Shahid and Ishaan were very protective of their mother from a very young age and in a recent chat, Neliima shared an anecdote when a six-year old Shahid confronted a French man who was following his mother.
In a chat with Rashmi Uchil for the book Raising Stars, Neliima recalled the time when she was performing in Belgium. ‚ÄúI was performing in Belgium once and a French guy kept following me around. Shahid was all of six then. He stood up to that guy and told him, ‚ÄòBefore you talk to her, you will have to deal with me. That‚Äôs my mother,'‚Äù she shared.
Neliima recalled another ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù incident which was rather ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù for her and even Ishaan, who was only three-and-a-half years old at the time, had the presence of mind to threaten the person by telling them that he would call the police. She recalled, ‚ÄúIshaan was equally astute. He was only 3 and a half years old when a rather unpleasant incident took place. He told the person who was getting aggressive with me, ‚ÄòI am watching you. Should I call the police?‚Äô Both my boys have been protective of me since a very early age.‚Äù

Aiden Markram expresses captaincy ambitions in IPL,"""What's going to happen, to be honest‚Ä¶ either way we back the management's decision about who they want to be in charge,"" Markram said.","One of the front-runners for Sunrisers Hyderabad‚Äôs captaincy in IPL-16, South African batter Aiden Markram is ready to take up the challenge if given a chance.
Besides Markram, seasoned opener Mayank Agarwal and veteran India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar are the other candidates in fray for the top job in the SRH franchise.
The 28-year-old Markram staked his claim by leading Sunrisers Eastern Cape into the final of the inaugural SA20 with a match-winning century in the last-four clash against Johannesburg Super Kings in Centurion on Thursday.
Mayank endured an unsuccessful stint as Punjab Kings captain before getting the boot. On the other hand, Markram has shown his leadership qualities by successfully leading the IPL franchise‚Äôs South African outfit.
Asked if he is open to leading the side in the high-profile Indian Premier League, Markram responded in the affirmative.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going to happen, to be honest‚Ä¶ either way we back the management‚Äôs decision about who they want to be in charge,‚Äù Markram said.
‚ÄúBecoming the captain is not the be all and end all. You can be in some form of leadership role too. But I am okay with captaincy, it‚Äôs something that I enjoy doing,‚Äù he said ahead of the SA20 final against Pretoria Capitals.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúI have been captaining for a while before this tournament started. It‚Äôs been a nice experience, a fresh start, I would say,‚Äù he added.
Mayank, who hit a double hundred in the ongoing Ranji Trophy semifinal against Saurashtra, has also brightened his chances of being named captain for the upcoming season of the T20 league.
Bhuvneshwar, 34, is SRH‚Äôs designated vice-captain and had led the side in former skipper Kane Williamson‚Äôs absence previously.
As far as Markram is concerned, the South African scored 381 runs in 14 matches at a strike rate of 139.5 last season. The only thing that could work against him is the lack of experience in leading a team in the IPL.

While Markram is entering the final on the back of a brilliant century, his opposite number, Wayne Parnell of Pretoria Capitals, has doubts over his participation in the title clash owing to a groin strain.
Both captains ‚Äî Markram and Parnell ‚Äî believed the quality of cricket in the first-ever SA20 league has been high and it has brought a breath of fresh air into South African cricket after a difficult period.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/aiden-markram-expresses-captaincy-ambitions-in-ipl-8439062/,sports
India‚Äôs Next Billion-Dollar Startup? Meet Chaitanya Laxman‚Äôs Laxcorp,"Chaitanya Laxman, a 25-year-old accomplished serial entrepreneur today unveiled his most ambitious venture yet, Laxcorp.","Chaitanya Laxman, a 25-year-old accomplished serial entrepreneur today unveiled his most ambitious venture yet, Laxcorp. Headquartered at WeWork Prestige Atlanta, Koramangala, Bangalore, Laxcorp is an AI company with a bold mission to ethically progress technology for empowerment and positive impact across industries.
‚ÄúWe are thrilled to officially launch Laxcorp and introduce our vision to proactively shape an inclusive, progressive future with responsible AI solutions. Our incredibly talented team gives us an invaluable foundation to maximise our contributions to society,‚Äù said Chaitanya.
The Driven Founder
Chaitanya brings years of expertise in founding startups, building enterprise products and leading engineering teams. At B2B SaaS provider TechLabs, Laxman pioneered innovations in learning management systems and enterprise integration, building it into a leader in its category. After a successful exit of a whopping ‚Çπ30.6Cr from TechLabs, Chaitanya stayed at LeadSquared, a billion-dollar SaaS company, to head its US Cloud initiatives. This record of consistently identifying emerging needs, developing category-defining products, and leading engineering teams put Chaitanya in the top tier of startup founders and technologists nationwide.
ADVERTISEMENT
Now, he is channelling his expertise towards artificial intelligence, assembling a world-class team to build Laxcorp as innovators at the intersection of AI and SaaS. Building an All-Star Team
At Laxcorp, he has assembled a world-class team of AI PhDs, veteran product experts, and engineering leaders to match its bold vision of developing transformative AI for good. While small in size, the team packs a powerful punch when it comes to building innovative high-velocity products.
Heading up software engineering is Adittya, a veteran who honed his talents at RailYatri, Quincus and PlanSource, where he architected infrastructure supporting millions of users. Other team members include Indrajith, Sathwik who are ex-Gojek, and Goldman Sachs.
Leading Laxcorp‚Äôs elite team of data scientists is Narendra Babu, a Ph.D. from IIIT Hyderabad with an extensive academic background developing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Narendra is serving as a Chief Data Scientist at Laxcorp to build innovative AI solutions. ‚ÄúOur engineering team intimately understands how to construct secure systems that intelligently leverage data at a massive scale. Their backend expertise wonderfully complements our data science team,‚Äù explained Chaitanya.

Rounding out Laxcorp‚Äôs all-star team are product/UX expert Krishna Sil and product developer Vishal Soni. Sil previously collaborated with Chaitanya at TechLabs, managing design and product requirements that resulted in highly intuitive, user-centric interfaces. His deep understanding of customer needs will ensure that Laxcorp‚Äôs solutions are accessible to all. Vishal is a gifted developer experienced at rapidly bringing concepts to life as polished web applications. Together Krishna and Vishal instil Laxcorp‚Äôs offerings with human-centric design and seamless functionality.
Together, these engineering leaders bring over 30 years of collective experience in designing, building, and operating complex platforms at a massive scale. Their technical expertise will ensure that Laxcorp‚Äôs AI solutions can make the biggest real-world impact with velocity and reliability.
Chaitanya believes the team itself is Laxcorp‚Äôs secret weapon. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve fostered an environment where exceptional individuals can invent freely. Their creativity is already generating groundbreaking innovations,‚Äù he added. Innovative Products Tackling Pressing Needs 
ADVERTISEMENT
Laxcorp is primed to deliver AI solutions that redefine what‚Äôs possible through products tackling four pressing needs:
Node0 helps developers overcome the challenge of securing applications by providing an intuitive API platform to easily integrate protections.
Nexus modernizes outdated recruitment practices by optimizing how companies evaluate and match candidates based on potential, not just credentials.
CiaraAI alleviates difficulties resolving issues in complex enterprise environments via natural language conversations and contextual responses.
TensorLearn tackles the growing tech skills gap by making hands-on education in emerging fields accessible.
The Time is Now for AI Innovation
When asked about the impetus behind launching now, Chaitanya explained: ‚ÄúThere couldn‚Äôt have been a better time to innovate in the AI space. Every day we are seeing AI models becoming more and more efficient. Tech entrepreneurs around the globe are starting to build solid use cases around that technology. It‚Äôs exactly like what happened in the 90s when the internet, web browsing, and website indexing capabilities of search engines gave birth to companies like Google, and Amazon. The so-called ‚Äú.com bubble‚Äù. Only this time it‚Äôs not a bubble. AI is here to stay and will change the very fundamentals of how software solves a problem. A lot of Enterprises are very appreciative of the cost-cutting capabilities (laughs) of AI and automation. For instance, the higher the number of support inquiries that can be fully automated by CiaraAI, the greater the cost reduction.‚Äù Studies show AI can automate 50-70% of routine support contacts. Enterprises with large, complex, and costly human support teams have greater room for efficiencies and cost savings. The deeper CiaraAI is integrated into the software systems, the more issues can be automated end-to-end. So, it‚Äôs safe to say that for a large enterprise, we estimate CiaraAI could likely reduce total customer support costs by 40-60%.‚Äù
Prioritising Product-Market Fit and Capitalising on Traction
When asked about fundraising plans, Chaitanya clarified: ‚ÄúWe are not particularly worried about the investments as of now. We have enough capital to launch our products and already working with a bunch of pilot customers, as we speak. I personally believe in showing value in terms of traction, basically product market fit. Once PMF is sorted, it‚Äôs easier for a founder to bargain valuations on his terms, Investors are not going anywhere‚Äù.
He continued, ‚ÄúOur products prove AI, when developed thoughtfully, can massively benefit people, and enterprises ‚Äì not just corporate profits. We passionately believe technology should serve humanity‚Äôs needs.‚Äù

Need for World Bank‚Äôs governance indicators to be transparent: CEA,The World Bank‚Äôs Worldwide Governance Indicators provide a ranking of 215 countries territories based on six dimensions of governance: ‚ÄòVoice and Accountability‚Äô; ‚ÄòPolitical Stability and Absence of Violence‚Äô; ‚ÄòGovernment Effectiveness‚Äô; ‚ÄòRegulatory Quality‚Äô; ‚ÄòRule of Law‚Äô and ‚ÄòControl of Corruption.‚Äô,"Raising concerns over the use of World Bank‚Äôs Worldwide Governance Indicators in ratings assessment by credit ratings agencies, especially for emerging economies, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran on Wednesday said there is a need for the World Governance Index to be more transparent and less subjective.
‚ÄúThe World Bank‚Ä¶.has something called the World Governance Index, which unfortunately or fortunately plays a very significant part in opaque and non-transparent ways in the credit rating assessment deployed by the three credit rating agencies in assigning letter-grades to credit rating of member countries, particularly emerging markets. This World Governance Index itself is a composite of several sub-indices, which are purely based on the subjective opinions of some so-called expert institutions which do not have presence on the ground nor do they understand whether the context in which they are making these judgements is appropriate or apt for the member countries. But these indices become an important part of the assessment methodology of the credit rating agencies and they do not reveal the extent to which these indices are implanted in their assessment process, the weights they carry, because there seems to be qualitative overlays on top of qualitative assessments,‚Äù Nageswaran said at a seminar on ‚ÄòMultilateral Institutions for the 21st Century‚Äô organised by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.

"India to flag concerns over EU‚Äôs carbon tax, deforestation regulation in WTO meet next year","India will address concerns on EU's climate regulations, including carbon tax and deforestation rules, during the WTO ministerial meet, seeking resolution for domestic industries","Developing countries like India will flag serious concerns over the impact of European Union‚Äôs (EU) regulations on climate change and trade such as carbon tax, on their domestic industry, during WTO ministerial meeting next year, an official said.
The four-day 13th ministerial conference (MC) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is scheduled for February 26 next year in Abu Dhabi. MC is the highest decision making body of WTO.
‚ÄúThese issues will come up in the WTO in a big way. Countries like India will oppose these measures in the WTO,‚Äù the official said.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the first seven months of this year, the EU has introduced four regulations on climate change and trade. These are carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM); deforestation regulation; including shipping in the EU‚Äôs emissions trade system; and Foreign subsidies regulation. EU member Germany too has announced a supply chain due diligence act (SCDDA).
‚ÄúThis will become a major issue in the MC13. Many member countries have already submitted papers against some of these regulations in the WTO. It looks like discussions will happen on these regulations and a general view will also converge,‚Äù the government official, who did not wish to be named, said.
Geneva-based 164 member multi-lateral body WTO deals with global exports and import-related norms. Besides, it adjudicates trade disputes between the member countries.
According to think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), the EU will collect billions annually once these provisions come into operation completely. They need these funds to provide subsidies to their companies and farmers.
ADVERTISEMENT
The carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will have an adverse impact on India‚Äôs exports of metals such as iron, steel and aluminium products to the EU. It will come into force from October 1 this year. CBAM will translate into a 20-35 per cent tax on select imports into the EU starting January 1, 2026.
From January 1, 2026, the EU will start collecting the carbon tax on each consignment of steel, aluminium, cement, fertilizer, hydrogen and electricity.
In 2022, India‚Äôs 27 per cent exports of iron, steel, and aluminium products of value USD 8.2 billion went to the EU.
ADVERTISEMENT
Further, India‚Äôs exports of products like coffee, leather hides and paperboard worth USD 1.3 billion annually to the EU will get impacted due to European Union Deforestation-Free Products Regulation (EU-DR).
The regulation covers cattle, buffalo, the meat of bovine animals, preparations, oil cake, soya beans, palm oil, cocoa bean, powder, chocolate, coffee, leather hide, skin, paper, paperboard, wood, wood articles, wood pulp, boards and wood furniture.
The exporters now have to ensure that these products have been grown on land, which has not been deforested after December 31, 2020.
The new rules will apply to large firms after 18 months and small firms after 24 months. Thus, the timeline for large firms is December 2024 and for small firms is June 2025.
As the EU parliament has included shipping in its emissions trade system on April 18 this year, it will charge a carbon tax like levy from EU‚Äôs inbound and outbound shipping firms from January 1, 2027.
ADVERTISEMENT
Similarly, under the Foreign subsidies regulation, which came into force on January 12 this year, the EU can investigate cases where foreign subsidies distort competition within the region.
The German law to prohibit forced labour and protect human rights in global business supply chains will have little impact on India‚Äôs trade with the European country as India already has comprehensive rules to deal with these issues, according to a report by GTRI.
ADVERTISEMENT
Germany has banned forced labour and other labour law violations in its supply chains extending within and outside Germany. The law, SCDDA, came into effect from January 1 this year.
It applies to firms with more than 3,000 employees. These include German firms and foreign firms doing business with Germany.
ADVERTISEMENT
India is already engaging bilaterally with the European Union on these issues.
India‚Äôs exports to the EU has increased to USD 74.9 billion in 2022-23 from about USD 65 billion in 2021-22. The EU accounts for over 16 per cent of India‚Äôs total merchandise exports. Imports from the EU rose to about USD 60 billion in 2022-23 as against USD 51.4 billion in 2021-22.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-concerns-eu-carbon-tax-deforestation-regulation-wto-meet-2024-8870816/,business

Nvidia delays launch of new China-focused AI chip,Nvidia is betting on the chips to help it preserve its market share in China after it was barred from shipping products including its advanced A800 and H800 AI chips by Washington's tightened export rules.,"Nvidia has told customers in China it is delaying the launch of a new artificial intelligence chip it designed to comply with U.S. export rules until the first quarter of next year, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The delayed chip is the H20, the most powerful of three China-focused chips Nvidia has developed to comply with fresh U.S. export restrictions, the sources said, and could complicate its efforts to preserve market share in China against local rivals like Huawei.
The California-based AI chip giant had been expected to launch the new products as early as Nov. 16, chip industry newsletter SemiAnalysis reported this month.

However, the H20 launch has now been pushed back until the first quarter of next year, the sources said, with one saying they were advised it could take place in February or March.

Both sources declined to be named as the information was confidential. Nvidia declined to comment.
The sources said they were told that the H20 was being delayed due to issues server manufacturers were having in integrating the chip.
In addition to the H20, Nvidia has been planning two other chips to comply with new U.S. export rules ‚Äì the L20 and L2. The sources said the L20 was not facing delays and would launch according to its original schedule. They were unable to share information on the status of the L2.

The A800 and H800 were introduced as alternatives for Chinese customers in November 2022, about a month after the U.S. first banned exports of advanced microchips and equipment to China.
The H20, L20 and L2 include most of Nvidia‚Äôs newest features for AI work, but have had some of their computing power measures cut back to comply with new U.S. rules, according to SemiAnalysis‚Äô analysis of the chips‚Äô specifications.
The U.S. export curbs have created an opportunity for rivals such as Huawei to win orders that may have otherwise gone to Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the AI market.

‚ÄòAI‚Äô is Collins Dictionary Word of the year 2023,"The Collins Dictionary has chosen AI, or artificial intelligence, as its Word of the Year 2023. Here are some of the others that made it to the shortlist.","A few years back, if you mentioned the acronym ‚ÄúAI‚Äù in common parlance, you would have had to be explaining that you are referring to artificial intelligence. Fast forward to 2023 and that is far from the case. You speak about AI and you will enter a conversation with someone who is a little scared about losing their job to a machine. And perhaps that is why the Collins dictionary chose ‚ÄúAI‚Äù as its word of the year for 2023.
The dictionary describes AI as ‚Äúthe modelling of human mental functions by computer programs.‚Äù It is perhaps only natural that AI was the word selected this year. Ever since ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, online searches for AI have surged. The AI market is projected to grow by nearly 800 per cent to around $1.8 trillion, according to the World Economic Forum.

Tennis Australia did not provide details, but a video emerged on social media showing a fan on the steps of Rod Laver Arena holding up a Russian flag with the image of President Vladimir Putin on it.
Russian and Belarusian flags are banned from Melbourne Park during the Australian Open after a complaint from the Ukraine ambassador to the country last week. Belarus is a key staging ground for Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine, which Moscow terms a ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù.
‚ÄúFour people in the crowd leaving the stadium revealed inappropriate flags and symbols and threatened security guards. Victoria Police intervened and are continuing to question them,‚Äù Tennis Australia said in a statement.
‚ÄúThe comfort and safety of everyone is our priority and we work closely with security and authorities.‚Äù

"Faced with boycotts and IOC pressure, IBA says Delhi World Boxing Championships will be Paris 2024 qualifier","Late on Monday, an IOC spokesperson told The Indian Express that the ""only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by IOC"" and reiterated that IBA's suspension was still in place.","Mumbai: Faced with boycott calls from national boxing federations of as many as eight countries, the International Boxing Association (IBA) has doubled down and designated the upcoming Women‚Äôs World Boxing Championships in New Delhi as the ‚Äúmain qualification event‚Äù for next year‚Äôs Paris Olympics along with the Men‚Äôs World Boxing Championships, to be held in Tashkent in May.
In the last 24 hours, the national boxing federations of the Netherlands and Switzerland had announced they were joining the list of nations to not send their boxers to the World Championships, which will be held from March 15 to 26 at New Delhi‚Äôs IG Sports Complex.
USA, Ireland, Great Britain, Canada, Sweden and Czech Republic had also threatened to boycott the event over the inclusion of Russian and Belarussian boxers, who have been allowed to compete under their flag and national anthems.
The move by the beleaguered IBA to announce its own Olympic Qualification System (OQS) for Paris 2024 was dismissed by the IOC. It had barred the IBA from organising the boxing event at the upcoming Olympics in Paris. The IOC had unequivocally said that it would be taking over the management of organising a qualification pathway for Paris 2024 as well. In fact, in September last year the IOC‚Äôs EB had approved its Paris 2024 qualification pathway, which would see continental events like the Asian Games being designated as quota events. After the five continental events were done, the IOC was to organise two more global events to offer quotas to boxers for Paris.
IOC reiterates that IBA is suspended
Late on Monday, an IOC spokesperson told The Indian Express, ‚ÄúAs announced by the IOC in June 2022, the IBA will not be involved in Paris 2024‚Äôs boxing qualifications and tournament. The only valid boxing qualification system for Paris 2024 is the one approved by the IOC EB in September 2022. Following an investigation and report by an IOC Inquiry Committee in 2019, recognition of the International Boxing Association was suspended by the IOC. This suspension is still in force today.‚Äù
Despite the IOC‚Äôs clarification, the presence of two so-called qualification pathways is likely to further split an already divided boxing world with one block of nations rallying around USA, Ireland and Great Britain while the other rallying around the IBA.
The IBA said that ‚Äúno other qualification process for Paris 2024 will be accepted by the IBA and the boxing community‚Äù. As per the IBA‚Äôs qualification system, the Women‚Äôs World Boxing Championships, Men‚Äôs World Boxing Championships, and an open event in May 2024 will be the tournaments offering direct quotas to the Paris Olympics.
ADVERTISEMENT
The IBA will also use world and continental ranking quotas besides handing out host country and universality spots.
‚ÄúWith less than 18 months to Paris 2024 and numerous delays on a clear International Olympic Committee (IOC) process being announced for Paris 2024 qualification, the IBA has taken upon itself, as the international governing body of boxing, to provide a clear process and pathway for its athletes to qualify for Paris 2024. The IBA OQS decision was unanimously taken by National Federations at the IBA Ordinary Congress in Abu Dhabi,‚Äù boxing‚Äôs global governing body said in a statement on Monday.
‚ÄúThis is a necessary step to protect our athletes as the IOC proposed qualification process consisting of one competition is not acceptable and fair for the athletes. To exclude World Champions from the upcoming Women‚Äôs and Men‚Äôs World Boxing Championships in New Delhi and Tashkent from qualifying for Paris 2024 is not acceptable and against the principles of sport and boxing,‚Äù it added.
As for the eight national boxing federations to have announced boycotts of the Worlds in New Delhi, the IBA said it would allow boxers to ‚Äúdirectly register‚Äù for the World Boxing Championships by sending an email to them and also promised to provide the boxers with financial aid through its Financial Support Program (FSP).
After widespread corruption among judges and referees at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics boxing event, IOC had snatched away the right to host the boxing event at the deferred Tokyo Olympics from IBA (then known as AIBA).
ADVERTISEMENT
Over the last few months, the IOC has also threatened to drop the sport completely from the Paris 2024 program if the IBA does not clean up its house. The sport did not make it to the initial sports program for the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, although it can be added later.
Beside corruption at the Rio Olympics, IOC has also been concerned by governance and fairness issues within the IBA. The fact that IBA gets most of its sponsorships funds through the Russian oil company Gazprom is an issue constantly raised by the critics of IBA president Umar Kremlev, who is also Russian.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/faced-with-boycotts-and-ioc-pressure-iba-says-delhi-world-boxing-championships-will-be-paris-2024-qualifier/,sports

"‚ÄòWhatsApp university‚Äô: Parekh flags financial misselling, says MFs‚Äô role key",Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India has been cracking the whip on unregistered entities or financial influencers (finfluencers) who are providing stock specific tips or advice on various social media platforms.,"Amid rising incidents of unregistered entities providing misleading stock recommendations to investors, HDFC Asset Management Company Chairman Deepak Parekh on Friday stated that mutual fund (MF) distributors can play an important role in driving financial literacy and ensuring investors remain invested for the long-term.
‚ÄúIn an era of easy online access of information or what is called the proliferation of ‚ÄúWhatsApp University‚Äù, there is also a lot of misinformation and misselling, despite all the safeguards put in place by the regulator.
‚ÄúThere are many ill-informed investors who start out with mutual funds and then abandon them thinking they can invest in the markets directly with a tip here and there only to end up burning their fingers. This is where your role as distributors is critical in ensuring investors stay invested for the long-term,‚Äù Parekh, who is also the Chairman of HDFC Life, said at an event organised by Franklin Templeton.

Apple now requires a judge‚Äôs consent to hand over push notification data,The new policy was not formally announced but appeared sometime over the past few days on Apple's publicly available law enforcement guidelines.,"Apple has said it now requires a judge‚Äôs order to hand over information about its customers‚Äô push notification to law enforcement, putting the iPhone maker‚Äôs policy in line with rival Google and raising the hurdle officials must clear to get app data about users.
The new policy was not formally announced but appeared sometime over the past few days on Apple‚Äôs publicly available law enforcement guidelines. It follows the revelation from Oregon Senator Ron Wyden that officials were requesting such data from Apple as well as from Google, the unit of Alphabet that makes the operating system for Android phones.
Apps of all kinds rely on push notifications to alert smartphone users to incoming messages, breaking news, and other updates. These are the audible ‚Äúdings‚Äù or visual indicators users get when they receive an email or their sports team wins a game. What users often do not realize is that almost all such notifications travel over Google and Apple‚Äôs servers.

In a letter first disclosed by Reuters last week, Wyden said the practice gave the two companies unique insight into traffic flowing from those apps to users, putting them ‚Äúin a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps.‚Äù
Apple and Google both acknowledged receiving such requests. Apple added a passage to its guidelines saying such data was available ‚Äúwith a subpoena or greater legal process.‚Äù The passage has now been updated to refer to more stringent warrant requirements.
Apple did not offer an official statement. Google did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
Wyden said in a statement that Apple was ‚Äúdoing the right thing by matching Google and requiring a court order to hand over push notification related data.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-now-requires-a-judges-consent-to-hand-over-push-notification-data-9065960/,technology
Leo movie review: Adam Sandler‚Äôs mildly anarchic Netflix film tackles problematic parenting with silly songs and subversion,"Leo movie review: Voicing a dying lizard, Adam Sandler brings pathos to Netflix's cute but chaotic new animated film about problematic parenting.","Adam Sandler voices a curmudgeonly (but chaotic) lizard named Leo in Netflix‚Äôs new animated movie, co-directed by his old collaborator Robert Smigel. They previously worked together on a couple of those very successful Hotel Transylvania movies, whose zany humour Leo is also laced with. Neither a children‚Äôs movie nor something that their parents can enjoy without rolling their eyes at least once, Leo exists in a limbo of its own making.
Having settled into a complacent existence in a fifth-grade classroom that he has called home since 1949, Leo and his best friend Squirtle (voiced by Bill Burr) have seen batch after batch of 10-year-olds come and go. This has made them experts in the field of child anthropology. In just one glance, for instance, Leo can tell if someone is an only child who‚Äôs never been told to shut up or an insecure urchin acting out because they‚Äôve been bullied themselves. Leo hasn‚Äôt ever taken an active interest in the children‚Äôs lives, but his standoffish attitude is given an unexpected shake when he learns one day that he basically has one year left to live.

"Disbursement under PLI scheme will be about Rs 13,000 crore this year: DPIIT secretary","Secretary in the Department for promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that from the current year onwards, the disbursal number will be significantly larger.","The government is expected to disburse about Rs 13,000 crore to eligible firms seeking benefits under the production linked incentive (PLI) schemes, even though an exercise is going on to tweak the scheme for those sectors which have not yet picked up well, a top official said on Friday.
Secretary in the Department for promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that from the current year onwards, the disbursal number will be significantly larger.
The disbursals ‚ÄúI think will go to about Rs 13,000 crore this year‚Äù, he told reporters here.
ADVERTISEMENT
The government disbursed only Rs 2,900 crore till March 2023 out of Rs 3,400 crore claims received under the scheme so far.
The scheme was announced in 2021 for 14 sectors such as telecommunications, white goods, textiles, manufacturing of medical devices, automobiles, speciality steel, food products, high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell battery, drones and pharma with an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore.
Asked about when the full fund would be disbursed, Singh said: ‚ÄúIt is difficult to say as so many factors come into play. But we expect that during the tenure of the scheme, a good part (of that) will get exhausted.‚Äù Savings from the scheme, he said, are already being considered for other PLI schemes or for restructured PLI schemes.
When asked about the restructured PLI schemes, the secretary said those are under various stages of inter-ministerial consultation.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThere are some course-corrections or tweaking that are required. Some are minor, some are major and that will require higher level approvals,‚Äù he said.
PLI schemes for sectors which are not picking up well include high-efficiency solar PV modules, advanced chemistry cell (ACC) batteries, textile products and speciality steel. On the other hand, the scheme is doing good in sectors such as electronics, pharma, medical devices, telecom, food processing, and white goods.
The government is trying to sort out issues such as timely processing of claims, visa-related matters where vendors require Chinese professionals‚Äô expertise, and delay in getting environmental clearances that have been raised by the stakeholders of production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes.
ADVERTISEMENT
The purpose of the schemes is to attract investments in key sectors and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiency and bring economies of size and scale in the manufacturing sector; and make Indian companies and manufacturers globally competitive.
These schemes for all 14 sectors have been notified by the concerned ministries/ departments after due approval. These schemes are in various stages of implementation. Out of the 733 applications selected under 14 sectors, 176 MSMEs are among the beneficiaries.
Singh also said that Rs 78,000 crore actual investments have already happened and ‚Äúwe have already generated sales of over Rs 6 lakh crore‚Äù, exports are boosted overall by Rs 2.6 lakh crore till 2022-23 adding about 4 lakh employment.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/pli-scheme-disbursement-rs-13000-crore-this-year-dpiit-secretary-8887701/,business

"‚ÄòWith flexibility, access to maths and science courses, engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad‚Äô","Although IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter).","‚Äî Chetan D. Pahlajani
It‚Äôs the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) season, and so amidst the anxiety and anticipation capping years of hard work, you possibly find yourself wondering: ‚ÄúIf I can make it to one of my preferred IITs, which BTech programme should I choose?‚Äù You look up the top choices: ‚ÄúOkay, Computer Science, then. But I think Mechanical or Electrical Engineering may be much broader. What about Chemical or Civil?‚Äù There‚Äôs input from friends and family, which might not all of is necessarily helpful. And then, perhaps, you love the sciences, but are ambivalent about engineering, and wonder: ‚ÄúIs engineering even the right choice for me? Perhaps I might be better off pursuing an Integrated MSc in the physical sciences.‚Äù
These are difficult questions with no easy answers, and so, when the time comes, one will have to make an important life decision with incomplete information. The good news is that very often, one‚Äôs academic and professional trajectory and eventual success may not depend so much on making the perfect choice, but simply on making a good enough choice. Part of the reason is that a good BTech programme at many of the IITs is a remarkably good springboard for a variety of career paths, as is evident from the biographies of numerous distinguished IIT alumni.

However, I want to turn my attention to the last group of students mentioned above, passionate about science but unsure about engineering. I too once belonged to that group, and following conventional wisdom at the time, chose engineering (though not at an IIT). What followed were a few not-so-happy years, but I fortunately had the opportunity to take several advanced Mathematics courses, and secured admission to a PhD programme in Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I wrote my doctoral thesis in Probability Theory guided by an advisor who, interestingly enough, had also started as a student in Electrical Engineering and then switched to a PhD in Applied Mathematics. I got a postdoctoral position, worked in the US for a few years, joined IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) in 2014, and lived happily ever after. More or less‚Ä¶
Anyway, back to you and your predicament. Well, one thing I have learned over the years is just how versatile an engineering degree can be, provided one can also take courses in one‚Äôs area of interest, whatever that may be. This brings me back to the IITs, specifically IITGN, since it is the only IIT where I have worked. Two big strengths of the BTech programme at IITGN are equipping engineering students with a solid foundation in the basic sciences, and providing students the chance to explore numerous courses outside their major. With Mathematics, all students are required to take a few core courses: single and multivariable calculus, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and numerical analysis. Additionally, each engineering department may require their students to take specific courses.
Although IITGN is a relatively young institution, we can offer a wide range of courses in numerous disciplines, allowing BTech students to take MSc/ PhD level courses in Mathematics and the Sciences (or Humanities and Social Sciences, for that matter). Further, students who have completed at least four semesters with satisfactory academic performance can also apply for a joint BTech/MSc dual degree, where the additional MSc degree can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. We recently had a BTech student from Mechanical Engineering take this route, also completing an MSc in Mathematics in the process. He is currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematics at Ohio State University.
The take-home message here is that with a bit of flexibility and access to Mathematics and Science courses, an Engineering degree can be an excellent launchpad for pursuing higher education and a career in these fields. Besides academics, Mathematics PhDs have found careers in Quantitative Finance, and more recently, in Data Science. And so, if you think your dream is to study the Navier-Stokes equations or Algebraic Geometry or Particle Physics or Neuroscience ‚Äî but you‚Äôre not yet sure ‚Äî a good BTech programme might not be a bad place to start.

"Propelled by core income growth, ICICI Bank net profit zooms 44% in Apr-Jun",Go Airline's resolution professional has yet to verify the veracity of the claims and did not immediately respond to a Reuters' email seeking comment.,"Go Airlines (India) Ltd has received claims worth 240 billion rupees ($2.9 billion) from operational and financial creditors so far as part of the carrier‚Äôs ongoing insolvency, two banking sources told Reuters.
The process is in line with procedural requirements under Indian law which allow every creditor a right to payment and remedy by submitting claims if a company is under bankruptcy. Once the claims are filed, the resolution professional has to check its authenticity.
‚ÄúClaims from the lenders are around 50 billion rupees, while lessors‚Äô claims amount to 180 billion rupees so far,‚Äù a banker with a state-run bank, who has exposure to Go Airlines said, after a meeting of the committee of creditors on Friday. The bankers did not wish to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.

Go Airline‚Äôs resolution professional has yet to verify the veracity of the claims and did not immediately respond to a Reuters‚Äô email seeking comment.
Go Airlines, which operated the Go First carrier, filed for bankruptcy protection in May blaming ‚Äúfaulty‚Äù Pratt & Whitney engines for the grounding of about half its 54 Airbus A320neos.
The Raytheon-owned engine maker has said the claims are without merit. The company earlier this month invited investor interest in the company through a court-appointed administrator. The last date to submit an expression of interest (EoI) is August 9.
‚ÄúThe airline has received 40 queries on EOIs from potential bidders, but no formal submissions have been made as yet,‚Äù the second banker said.

Rishi Sunak asks Elon Musk tough questions on AI: 6 key things discussed,Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk sat down for a candid conversation on AI. The duo discussed the potential and challenges of AI in the hour-long session.,"At a time when Artificial Intelligence is dominating the conversations around the world, what world leaders say could indicate how governments intend to treat the technology. Even as we witness some remarkable capabilities, some questions remain unanswered. The UK recently hosted the AI Safety Summit, and as part of the summit, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak hosted Elon Musk for a Q and A session. 
The wide-ranging discussion saw Sunak and Musk speak on the need to balance AI‚Äôs potential and risks. The SpaceX chief shared his long-standing concerns on why the world should proceed cautiously when it came to developing AI technologies. The duo in the conversation also agreed on the significance of governments in overseeing public safety and the need for companies to collaborate in a responsible manner. 
The conversation also explored the benefits of AI in terms of education, productivity, economy and equal access. They also touched upon the challenges that loom large in combating misinformation caused by AI. The long discussion also saw the leaders expressing their optimism.

Here are key takeaways from the conversation between Rishi Sunak and Elon Musk:
Developing AI safely
Sunak opened the discussion by quoting Bill Gates, who once hailed Musk as someone who has done more to push the limits of science and innovation in our times. He went on to ask Musk to share his thoughts on how it felt to be held in such high regard by Gates. In his response, Musk quipped, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a nice thing to have anyone say about you, especially coming from Bill Gates.‚Äù
He soon shifted his focus to AI, on which, for nearly a decade, he has been talking about how the world needs to practise caution with AI to make it safe. While sharing his earlier concerns, Musk also acknowledged the progress in AI, such as GPT-3, adding that there is a proactive need to mitigate potential risks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad people are taking safety seriously now. I think this AI safety conference will go down in history as very important. The potential is there for AI to have a positive effect and create abundance, but there is a ‚Äògenie problem‚Äô ‚Äì if you have a genie granting unlimited wishes, those stories don‚Äôt usually end well. We need to mitigate the downside potential,‚Äù he said. 
Governments as referee
Talking about the AI Safety Summit, Musk said that he felt it is good for governments to play an active role when it comes to public safety. With the rise of digital superintelligence, Musk said that there was a need for governments to play the role of ‚Äòreferee‚Äô to make sure there is sportsman-like conduct and public safety concerns are addressed efficiently. He went on to say that he has been familiar with regulators in cars, aviation and rockets. While he agreed with most regulations, there were less than 1 per cent that he disagreed with. 
ADVERTISEMENT
Addressing the concerns from Silicon Valley over regulations, Musk maintained that having a referee was good, just like in sports. He also said that even without regulations of enforcement capabilities, governments simply highlighting concerns can be powerful.

On the impact of AI on jobs
Musk called AI the most disruptive force in history. According to him, for the first time, something will be smarter than the smartest human. He went on to say that, at some point, AI will do everything. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if that makes people comfortable or uncomfortable. It‚Äôs like a magic genie ‚Äì be careful what you wish for,‚Äù he said. Musk went on to say that finding meaning in life will be challenging. He cited the Olympics, saying how humans compete with each other to be the best human, and there is meaning in that. 
AI as tutors and companions 
The Tesla CEO also said that AI tutors could be ‚Äòamazing‚Äô. He said AI can be the most patient tutor on any subject. He said that they can be great for companionship, essentially an AI friend with memory of all your interactions, reading everything about you, talking to you every day, etc. The 52-year-old said that for those with learning disabilities or having trouble making friends, an AI friend could be a great asset. He went on to recommend the sci-fi novels in the Culture Series by Scottish author Ian M Banks.
AI as an enabler
When asked about what he thought about risk appetite among companies and his notions on failure, Musk spoke about perseverance. He said that if your first start-up fails, that should not be the end of your career, instead, try again. While saying that stock options are difficult in Europe, Musk said that start-ups are high-risk and high-reward. 
ADVERTISEMENT
He also said that social media platforms are facing challenges from AI bots that are capable of passing captcha tests and manipulating information. According to him, a minor cost to use platforms could be of great help in combating bots, essentially making it expensive to create fake accounts.

On gaining public trust 
With reference to upcoming elections around the world, Sunak asked about the critical nature of managing information integrity. The X chief said that authentication of real vs AI-created media could be beneficial to gaining public trust and addressing the problem of misinformation. He cited that entertainment content, like the Pope in a Balenciaga puffer jacket, is still believed to be true by many. 
Regardless of the challenges, Musk said that this was the most interesting time. He said that, with AI, there was an 80 per cent likelihood of being net positive, and if we are cognizant about the 20 per cent downside risk, then, AI could be a great equaliser.

‚ÄúI am going to handover a letter to the Finance Minister this evening stating that an additional 10 per cent GST be put on diesel-powered vehicles,‚Äù Gadkari said, adding that said the rising level of pollution is a health hazard for citizens, PTI quoted.
At the event, Gadkari said, ‚ÄúSay goodbye to diesel‚Ä¶ Please stop making them, otherwise we will just increase the tax so much that it would become difficult to sell diesel cars.‚Äù He said he will propose additional GST on diesel-powered generators as well.
In his clarification on X, Gadkari wrote, ‚ÄúIn line with our commitments to achieve Carbon Net Zero by 2070 and to reduce air pollution levels caused by hazardous fuels like diesel, as well as the rapid growth in automobile sales, it is imperative to actively embrace cleaner and greener alternative fuels. These fuels should be import substitutes, cost-effective, indigenous, and pollution-free.‚Äù
Currently, automobiles are taxed at 28 per cent GST, with additional cess ranging from 1 per cent to 22 per cent depending on the type of vehicle.

Javed Akhtar bashes Yash Chopra‚Äôs Jab Tak Hai Jaan for ‚Äòridiculous‚Äô portrayal of modern woman: ‚ÄòWhen the heroine says she will sleep with‚Ä¶‚Äô,Javed Akhtar expressed the ongoing struggle to define the modern woman in the Hindi cinema. He took examples of Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit and how they never got big roles in their careers.,"Javed Akhtar delved into the evolving concept of the modern woman in Hindi cinema in a recent interview. Reflecting on the historical depiction of women as submissive and quiet, Akhtar acknowledged the industry‚Äôs shift towards questioning these stereotypes. Despite this evolution, Akhtar expressed the ongoing struggle to define the modern woman. The screenwriter took examples of iconic actors Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit and how they never got big roles in their careers. He also bashed Yash Chopra‚Äôs film, Jab Tak Hai Jaan, for its ‚Äòridiculous‚Äô idea of an empowered woman.
Speaking about it on ABP Majha, Akhtar said, ‚ÄúWho is the new woman? We are not clear about it. There are two reasons for it. Those who are liberal, if they define this as a modern woman, other liberals will question them. Those who are conservative, if they define it, they feel that they will lose a lot of their territory. So, they don‚Äôt want to do it. There were so many talented women -Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit ‚Äì they weren‚Äôt any less talented than any of the actors, but they didn‚Äôt get a big role in their whole career. For instance, they didn‚Äôt get roles like Mother India, Bandini and Sujata. It is because people don‚Äôt know what is an ideal woman.‚Äù

Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro first impressions: Another attempt towards ‚Äòmainstreaming‚Äô gaming smartphones,"Asus has made some bold changes to the ROG Phone 8 Pro, and I'm loving it.","While some of its competitors are going for completely flat backs and unobstructed screens with under-display cameras, Asus decided it was time to ditch those awesome front-firing speakers and go for a more ‚Äònormal‚Äô combo of bottom-firing speakers and an earpiece. But in making that move, Asus has finally freed the ROG Phones from bezels for the first time. And that‚Äôs just one of many changes Asus has made to the ROG Phone this year.
The bezels, quite surprisingly, were near-symmetrical all around. (Image: Zohaib Ahmed/The Indian Express)
The ROG Phone 8 series is taking a more ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù approach in 2024, aiming to appeal to a wider set of smartphone users rather than just the niche pro-gamer crowd. Aside from slimmer bezels, Asus has upgraded the cameras to include a telephoto lens for the first time, added wireless charging, and toned down the gamer aesthetic for a more mature look. But that‚Äôs not all ‚Äì the phones are also slimmer, lighter, and now IP68 water and dust-resistant, a big step up from the basic IP54 rating of the previous models.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Steve Smith‚Äôs reboot that makes him so dangerous,"Steve Smith delved into the changes he brought about in his batting that have turned him into a run-machine, across all formats.","It all started after a not so bad series when he returned home ready to tweak his game, according to a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald. It started with the end of the trademark Smith shuffle.
‚ÄúSmith had just played the series of his life, collaring 774 runs at 110.57 in four Tests on tricky English pitches to be the biggest single reason Australia retained the Ashes.
Yet it was in the aftermath of that achievement, perhaps even as soon as the flight home, that Smith started thinking about where to take his game next.
Over a long and sometimes tortuous journey, opponents harried him with short balls and leg-side fields, but Smith reached a point of resolution at the outset of this summer after he had abandoned his trademark shuffle across the crease in mid-year,‚Äù SMH wrote.
Speaking after winning his fourth Allan Border Medal in Sydney, Smith described his journey. ‚ÄúProbably in about 2019 when I came back here after the Ashes. It sounds really strange because that obviously had been a really good Ashes, but I felt like my mind was in a good place and I was playing really well in terms of my thinking and my mental side of the game.
‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think I was hitting the ball quite as well as I probably have done and then it probably exposed a couple of little weaknesses when I came back that I wanted to rectify.‚Äù
The India blueprint circa 2014-15
SMH wrote, ‚ÄòFor Smith, the sweet spot of his career was the summer of 2014-15, when he dominated India and was the fulcrum of Australia‚Äôs ODI World Cup win on home soil. At the time, he was known to confide ‚Äúno one knows how to get me out‚Äù, and batted like it. But from 2019, it took until a session in Adelaide ‚Äì just before Australia would be eliminated from the Twenty20 World Cup ‚Äì for all the components of feet, hands and weight transfer to get into sync. Smith‚Äôs first attempt to demonstrate the changes was derailed by COVID-19, which he carried into the game against Afghanistan.‚Äô

He would elaborate: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve looked at footage for so long like you wouldn‚Äôt believe, just of innings mainly in 2015,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think that was when I was batting my best in the Indian series at home and throughout that World Cup and that‚Äôs my blueprint that I always go back to, to try and figure out what I was doing there.
Steve Smith bats during the one day cricket international between England and Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, in Sydney, Australia, Saturday, Nov. 19, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark Baker)
‚ÄúI finally got there. I was in the nets. I think in might have been in Adelaide just before the T20 game against Afghanistan. I felt like I‚Äôd found something and then I got COVID.
‚ÄúI played with COVID that game and I didn‚Äôt really get a chance to get in the middle to sort of implement it. And then the next game I played was against England and that game I think, I scored 80 not out.
‚ÄúAnd yeah, that was just the first time I‚Äôd put it all into practice in the middle and it just clicked for me. We‚Äôre always looking for those things to make you better. Fortunate that I stumbled across it finally and hopefully, it keeps working well for me.‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
He would call a cover drive played at Adelaide as the single moment when he mouthed: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm back, baby‚Äù, SMH wrote, noting ‚Äúacross 16 innings in all formats since, Smith has hammered 1027 runs at 85.58 with four centuries.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt was probably that ball that I hit through the covers, just my weight transfer through the ball,‚Äù he was quoted. ‚ÄúThe way my hands went through it and I‚Äôd felt it a little bit in the nets but I hadn‚Äôt implemented it in the game yet.
‚ÄúSo as soon as I hit that shot I was kind of like, I‚Äôve just found something has clicked. It‚Äôs the rhythm I‚Äôve been searching for and yeah, I made it pretty clear, I think straight away. So yeah, a bold statement but it felt as though it, you know, I‚Äôd nailed it.‚Äù

Mithali, the highest run-getter in women‚Äôs international cricket, had retired last year from all formats after a 23-year-long career.
As mentor of the side, the 40-year-old cricketer will also promote women‚Äôs cricket and help develop the sport at the grassroots level in Gujarat.

Mithali said the new BCCI initiative will help women‚Äôs cricket grow steadily and encourage young players to take up cricket professionally.
‚ÄúThe inaugural season of the Women‚Äôs Premier League is a fantastic move for women‚Äôs cricket and the involvement of the Adani Group is a massive boost for the sport as well,‚Äù said Mithali on Saturday.
‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs cricket is growing steadily, and this kind of impetus will undoubtedly encourage young women to consider taking up cricket professionally.

"Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar movie review: Poetic and profound, the best Hindi film of the year","Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar movie review: Out on Mubi after playing at festivals last year, the Darbhanga-set drama is a technical and narrative marvel; an unmissable piece of filmmaking.","A delicately paced document of urban decay, a loving tribute to human resilience, and a last-minute rescue operation for a film industry drowning in a ditch of mediocrity, director Parth Saurabh‚Äôs Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar is the best Hindi movie of the year. Released on Mubi, it tells the story of an eloped couple who return to their hometown of Darbhanga, as they reel from the financial aftershocks of the pandemic and hold on to the last vestiges of romance as practicality rears its ugly head.
Unlike most conventional films, Pokhar Ke Dunu Paar is more interested in the moments after the drama. We never see how Sumit and Priyanka, played by the phenomenal Abhinav Jha and Tanaya Jha Khan, actually made their relationship work, much less how they managed to run away. Nor do we ever cut away to the disgruntled dad who is often mentioned through the course of the film‚Äôs lean, but thematically rich, narrative. We‚Äôre left to exist alongside Sumit and Priyanka, as they reckon with the magnitude of the decision they‚Äôve made, perhaps having imagined an idyllic life together. Think of it as a feature-length expansion of the memorable final shot of The Graduate, in which Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross contemplate an uncertain future after getting married in a moment of mad passion.

"No Ma Long, but Table Tennis Star Contender has enough stalwarts to attract fans","Unprecedented interest from top players, but many had to miss out due to world body‚Äôs restrictions.","When organisers of World Table Tennis (WTT) Star Contender Goa received entries for the main event, that begins in Panaji on Wednesday, they were astounded.
Ma Long, two-time Olympic singles champion and three-time world champion had decided to compete at the event.
Now, Long is to table tennis what Lionel Messi is to football, Roger Federer is to tennis, and Tom Brady is to NFL. To see him compete live in India would be a dream come true for lovers of the sport.
It was also the first time that the organisers received as many as 17 entries from top-20 players in both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs singles. Apart from Long, they included current Olympic women‚Äôs champion Chen Meng. Unfortunately, WTT has a Play Down Restriction (PDR) meaning that only the top 6 of the top 20 players can feature in the Star Contender event. That meant the organisers had an arduous task of telling at least seven top-20 players that they couldn‚Äôt come to Goa.
In further disappointment, just as the billboards screaming of Long‚Äôs presence in the country were up and fans had booked tickets with the anticipation of seeing the legend as well as the top Chinese contingent playing in the country, WTT announced that Long, Meng, women‚Äôs World No. 1 Sun Yingsha and World No. 3 Wang Manyu, and men‚Äôs World No. 3 Wang Chuqin had pulled out of the tournament with either Covid or injury, just two days before the start of the main draw.
While that was a dampener, China sent four other players as replacements for their top players.
Despite the withdrawals, with WTT nominations and wildcards, the event will see as many as 11 top-20 players in men‚Äôs singles and 10 top-20 players in women‚Äôs singles.
Big events, big names
ADVERTISEMENT
It‚Äôs the first time that India is hosting a WTT event and that‚Äôs thanks to International Table Tennis Federation‚Äôs (ITTF) partnership with Stupa Sports Analytics, a company based in Delhi that specialises in performance analytics and event management. A Star Contender event is third in the hierarchy of table tennis tournaments, below WTT Grand Smash and Champions. The qualifying rounds of the event began at the Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Indoor Stadium in Panaji on Monday.
Megha Gambhir, CEO of Stupa, said the unprecedented response may be due to the fact that its being held in Goa.
‚ÄúOne of the primary reasons we chose Goa is because it‚Äôs a tourist destination. We thought that since it‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôre having a WTT event in India, the players and fans should have something more to look forward to than just table tennis. Normally, it takes a year‚Äôs planning to host an event of such magnitude but we‚Äôve done it in a short span of two months. That‚Äôs because we‚Äôve received phenomenal support from the government, Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI), and all the stakeholders,‚Äù Megha told The Indian Express.
World No. 1 Fan Zhendong of China is the top seed in the men‚Äôs event and will be challenged by World No. 4 Tomokazu Harimoto, the lone Japanese in the top-20 of the world rankings who has had some fabulous victories over his Chinese counterparts in the past year.
ADVERTISEMENT
With Meng‚Äôs absence in the women‚Äôs singles, Chinese World No. 4 Wang Yidi will lead the charge, challenged by the Japanese duo of World No. 6 Hina Hayata and World No. 8 Kasumi Ishikawa.
The fact that the event has got so many top entries even baffled WTT organisers, who managed to put it into perspective.
‚ÄúFor sure, we don‚Äôt normally see this many top-20 entries for a Star Contender but we have the Singapore Smash next week, so players love the combination of first coming to Goa and then going to Singapore,‚Äù Bart Vermoesen, WTT‚Äôs event supervisor, told The Indian Express on Tuesday.
‚ÄòTT in India has grown exponentially‚Äô
India‚Äôs top-ranked player G Sathiyan has been a familiar face at top WTT tournaments over the past couple of years. The World No. 41 and Manika Batra are the top-ranked Indians at the event.
Then there‚Äôs the evergreen Sharath Kamal. The 40-year-old eight-time Commonwealth Games medallist, ranked only a few notches below Sathiyan in world rankings, is known to rise to the occasion. And what better occasion than his country hosting a premier tournament that boasts of big names for the first time since the 1987 World Championships held in New Delhi?
ADVERTISEMENT
The men‚Äôs singles main draw also features 18-year-old Payas Jain and 21-year-old Wesley Do Rosario as wildcards. National Games champion Harmeet Desai beat Argentinian Horacio Cifuentes 3-2 in Round 3 of qualifiers to make it to the main draw.
The women‚Äôs singles main draw has Manika, the highest-ranked Indian at 34, national champion Sreeja Akula and 16-year-old Suhana Saini. Indian women did fabulously in qualifiers to dominate South Koreans to make their way into the main draw. Yashaswini Ghorpade beat Kim Nayeong 3-2 while National Games champ Sutirtha Mukherjee dominated Lee Eunhye 3-1.
The men‚Äôs doubles main draw will see Sharath and Sathiyan leading the Indian challenge along with Harmeet and Manav while Manika along with Archana Kamath will be seen in action along with the duo of Sreeja and Diya.
India‚Äôs best chance is in the mixed doubles event that will see Sathiyan and Manika pair up. The duo has been in sparkling form of late, reaching the semifinals of the Doha Contender in January.
ADVERTISEMENT
This event will certainly see the most number of Indians at a WTT Contender event and Sathiyan cannot stop beaming about it.
‚ÄúTo play on such a platform is a great beginning for Indian table tennis to go even more global. The country is becoming a powerhouse and these tournaments will help us surely. Table tennis in India has definitely grown exponentially in the past four-five years. In fact, I‚Äôll go as far as saying that it‚Äôs the most improved sport in that time period in India,‚Äù he said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/no-ma-long-but-table-tennis-star-contender-has-manika-batra-sharath-kamal-g-sathiyan-sreeja-akula-8472073/,sports

Indian Ravin Jain is new Ferrari F1 team‚Äôs head of strategy,Ravin Jain will begin the high-pressure job at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix next weekend.,"Ferrari‚Äôs long-serving race strategy engineer Ravin Jain has taken over from Spaniard Inaki Rueda as the head of strategy of the iconic car-maker‚Äôs F1 team.
Jain will begin the high-pressure job at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix next weekend. Reports say the Ferrari F1 team management decided to promote Jain following quite a few high-profile errors last season.
Ferrari did well last season with Charles Leclerc finishing second behind title winner Max Verstappen of Red Bull. Their other driver George Russell was fourth. Some of the questionable calls made last year included a bad pit strategy during the Monaco Grand Prix which cost Leclerc a potential win, while at the Brazilian Grand Prix, he was the only driver on intermediate tyres for the start of Qualification 3.
In the backdrop of the two questionable decisions, Ferrari‚Äôs new team principal Fred Vasseur, who took over from Mattia Binotto, decided to ease out Rueda from the role and make the Oxford-graduate Indian with a first-class degree in physics, the head of strategy.
Jain joined Scuderia Ferrari in 2017 and, over the last six years, rose to the post of Race Strategy Engineer. Rueda will continue to be a part of the team with a factory-based sporting role at Ferrari‚Äôs headquarters in Maranello.

"‚ÄòWill densify network, want to be at least no. 2 in any city pair‚Äô: Air India Express MD","'In terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments‚Äî15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international,' says AI Express‚Äôs Managing Director Aloke Singh","The merger of Tata group‚Äôs budget airlines Air India Express (AI Express) and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) into one carrier ‚Äî AI Express ‚Äî is on track for completion in the next three to four months, even as operational integration of the two is nearly complete. According to AI Express‚Äôs Managing Director Aloke Singh, the airline in its brand-new avatar aspires to double its market share by 2028, more than triple its fleet size to 180 aircraft, and build a dense network focussed on tier-two and tier-three cities, all while working in synergy with parent Air India to realise the group‚Äôs vision of emerging as a formidable player in India and beyond.
In an interaction with SUKALP SHARMA, Singh gives a lowdown of AI Express‚Äôs vision and strategy to chart ambitious growth in the coming years. Edited Excerpts:
How is the integration of AI Express and AIX Connect coming along?
The past year has been all about the integration, which involves integrating systems, processes, platforms, people, brand, networks and fleets. We have tweaked the combined network to facilitate flows between the two networks. That integration is now moving into a merger, which we hope to complete in three to four months. Simultaneously, a massive growth agenda has kicked in. We are now inducting aircraft at a rate of three-and-a-half per month, and it will continue for a while.
ADVERTISEMENT
With steady supply of new aircraft, what shape will your network take?
The new capacity will help us grow significantly. This growth will come from our existing markets as well as some new ones. In our existing markets, we will densify the network and plug gaps that we could not address earlier due to capacity constraints. The broad network strategy is that we will first consolidate our presence and become stronger wherever we already operate. We want to be at least the number two player in any city pair. We don‚Äôt want to open too many new stations together. We want to open one station, deploy capacity there to increase connectivity, and spread out from there. As we become firm in a market, it will also help us in rationalising costs.
AI Express was almost exclusively a short-haul international carrier while AIX Connect was a domestic airline. Should we expect the combined entity to be more focussed on the domestic market?
If you put the two networks together, we roughly have 50 per cent capacity each on domestic and international. This will remain so for the next year or two. The domestic portion will then grow to some extent. We will probably end up with about 60 per cent domestic and 40 per cent international. The domestic market is much bigger and our capacity deployment will reflect that.
In terms of market share, we aim to double it by 2028 in both segments‚Äî15 per cent in the domestic and 20 per cent in short-haul international.
What is the status of network optimisation at the group level between the full-service carrier (Air India) and the budget carrier (AI Express)?
It has started and will be a continuous process as the nature of markets is dynamic. Route rationalisation at the group level has begun. Different operational models suit different markets. If we see that a market is better served in financial terms by the low-cost model, then we will deploy the relevant product. There will be markets where operating premium products will offer an upside, so the full-service product will be offered there. In markets and segments that are big and deep enough, we would look at straddling both product offerings.
ADVERTISEMENT
 The market sees IndiGo, which has a domestic market share of over 60 per cent, as your biggest competitor. How do you look at that challenge?
The market is big enough and deep enough, and has space for a number of players. The broad thrust of our network strategy will be a lot more focus on tier-two and tier-three cities. We will also focus on international operations from tier-two cities, because that is a space we understand very well. We will not be concentrating our capacity on large cities. Of course, there will be some capacity deployed there, but a large part will be for tier-two, tier-three cities.
So, you are looking at a point-to-point network instead of hub-and-spoke?
Yes, it will not be focussed on a large hub. However, our network will have a number a focus cities, probably 10, where we will also transfer passengers. Like, Kochi may not be a hub per se, but it has significant potential for domestic-to-domestic, international-to-domestic, and even international-to-international transfers. Similarly, we are connecting Bangalore, where we have a dense network, to our points in Kerala. For example, we can offer travel from Ayodhya to Kochi via Bangalore, or a Lucknow-Bangalore-Trivandrum connection.
Air India Express operated Boeing 737s while AIX Connect had Airbus A320s. Do you now plan to operate both or retire the A320s?
We will have a mixed fleet. You have to look at the fleet from the group perspective. The fleet will be fungible. We want that flexibility. Having a mixed fleet may have some sub-optimality, but with scale, fleet commonality benefits diminish. If you have 200 or 300 or 400 aircraft, due to the large scale of operations, a mixed fleet is not too different from a single-type fleet.
ADVERTISEMENT
Our plan is to have a fleet size of about 180 aircraft by 2028. We have a legacy fleet of 26 737NGs (737 Next Generation), of which 10 are leased, and 28 A320s, all of which are leased. The leased aircraft will start going back to lessors starting this year.
The Air India group‚Äôs 470-aircraft order includes 190 Boeing 737 MAX planes. Are all of those going to come to Air India Express?
So far, we have not taken that call at the group level. The aircraft deliveries will stretch over years. Some of the Airbus A320s and A321s (also part of the order) may even come our (Air India Express) way. Aircraft type within the group will remain fungible given the long delivery schedule and the decisions will be based on synergies within the group like aircraft engineering and maintenance. But certainly, Air India Express will operate under an all-economy model.
Considering Air India Express has mostly been a short-haul international carrier and given the growth trajectory you are eyeing, are you looking to get into wide-body operations as well?
No, we have no such plans at present. We first want to grow and scale up with our current model (low-cost domestic and short-haul international operations), before thinking about anything else.
By when can we see your legacy fleet in the new Air India Express branding?
We are not going to change the livery on the legacy fleet. One reason is that many of those aircraft will be going back to lessors once the leases expire. Secondly, we want to prioritise the new aircraft, as the painting capacity in the MROs (maintenance, repair, and overhaul units) is limited. We want to paint the new aircraft first and then take a call on the older ones. In any airline‚Äôs livery change programme, it takes years for 100 per cent of the aircraft to get rebranded.
Given your thrust on tier-two and tier-three cities, will we see Air India Express applying for routes under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik)?
Certainly, we could look at it, if it fits into our route strategy. We would be really interested in international UDAN, but there could be some domestic routes also that could make sense for us.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/interview-with-aloke-singh-md-air-india-express-9128164/,business

"Just Fontaine, who scored 13 goals at 1958 World Cup, dies",The highest scorer at the World Cup is now acknowledged with the Golden Boot. Fontaine set the record when FIFA did not present a specific award for the tournament's top scorer.,"Just Fontaine, the French soccer great who scored a record 13 goals at the 1958 World Cup, has died. He was 89. Fontaine‚Äôs former club Reims announced his death on Wednesday.
Fontaine took six games to achieve his feat at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, when he was a last-minute inclusion on the French squad.
Entering the tournament, the Moroccan-born Fontaine was a little-known forward outside of the French league. Yet he tormented opponents with his speed and finishing touch ‚Äî and even with someone else‚Äôs boots. He had to borrow a pair of cleats after damaging his own boots in practice.
Fontaine scored four goals in the third-place game against West Germany, but could have had five if he had taken the penalty kick.
The highest scorer at the World Cup is now acknowledged with the Golden Boot. Fontaine set the record when FIFA did not present a specific award for the tournament‚Äôs top scorer.

‚ÄúBeating my record? I don‚Äôt think it can ever be done,‚Äù Fontaine told The Associated Press in a 2006 interview.
‚ÄúThe person who wants to beat me has a massive task, doesn‚Äôt he? He has to score two goals per game over seven games.‚Äù Playing in the days when no substitutions were allowed, France lost 5-2 in the semifinals against a Brazil team featuring 17-year-old Pele.
Fontaine, who scored in every match, gave France an early lead with the first goal Brazil allowed in the tournament. But at 1-1, France defender Robert Jonquet broke his leg. Amazingly, he played on, trying to contend with the genius of Pele, but the French defense was considerably weakened.

The record for most goals scored in a World Cup career is 16 by Germany striker Miroslav Klose, who played in four tournaments. Fontaine, who broke the record of 11 goals Hungary striker S√°ndor Kocsis scored at the 1954 tournament, only played at one World Cup. Fontaine‚Äôs meteoric rise as a scorer saw him get 200 goals in 213 games. He scored 30 goals in 21 games for France.

"To have a say in key IIM appointments, Centre set to appoint President as Visitor",Move likely to curb autonomy granted to 20 B-schools when IIM Act was implemented in Jan 2018; comes against backdrop of a series of flashpoints.,"In a move that could potentially curb the autonomy granted to 20 Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) in 2017, the Centre on Friday introduced an amendment to the IIM Act in the parliament, proposing to make the President the Visitor of all B-schools.
The amendment, if comes effect, will strip the IIM Board of the power to select and appoint chairpersons and directors to the institutes. Under the amendments, the Visitor will have the power to appoint the Chairperson to the Board of Governors of the institute, and nominate an individual to the search-cum-selection committee for the positions of Director, giving the government a say in these crucial calls.
The Visitor will also have the power to appoint the Chairperson to the Coordination Forum of the institute, as per the Bill.
The Visitor would also be empowered to set up an inquiry against the institute in case of suspected irregularities, and remove the institute‚Äôs director, besides allowing the Central Government to ‚Äúconstitute an interim Board in case of suspension or dissolution of the said Board of Governors.‚Äù While the central government does not have any power at present to order the IIMs on any matter, the amendments make it so that any directive from the Ministry of Education would have to be implemented by the institute.
This is the second attempt by the union government at curbing the autonomy granted to the 20 premier Business-schools. In December 2020, The Indian Express had reported on how the Education Ministry had a draft executive order with the Law Ministry with a proposal to empower the Government to initiate an inquiry against the Board of Governors of an institute if it‚Äôs ostensibly found to be acting in contravention of the Act. The proposal was eventually shot down by the Law Ministry as it went against the grain of the IIM Act.
These developments come five years after the IIM Act came into effect on January 31, 2018, giving sweeping powers to all 20 business schools, including appointment of directors, chairpersons and Board members. Earlier, the director was appointed by the board but with the prior approval of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister.
In September 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to the autonomy granted to IIMs, had said, ‚ÄúSarkar kahin nahi aayegi, koi babu aakar nahi baithega (Government will not interfere, no officer will have any role).‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
However, since then, the Government and the IIMs have been at odds on a range of issues, including the one-year MBA degree rolled out by the institutes.
In July 2020, the Education Ministry red-flagged the one-year executive MBA degree, saying it is ‚Äúnot in accordance with the UGC Regulations‚Äù. However, the IIMs defended their decision and continued to run the programme.
These included IIM Rohtak‚Äôs attempt at appointing its BoG chairperson by a circular resolution instead of approving the selection in a formal meeting attended by members.
In 2019, IIM Ahmedabad had appointed former Gujarat police officer, who had arrested a few police officers in 2007 in connection with the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, to its faculty. When the decision was questioned by the Home Ministry, the institute stuck to its guns citing its autonomy under the IIM Act.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, one the biggest points of the contention between the government and the IIM has been the reappointment of Dheeraj Sharma as the the director of IIM Rohtak. Sharma‚Äôs first term, it has now emerged, was illegal since he lacked the academic credentials for it. Although his reappointment was opposed by the ministry representative on the institute‚Äôs Board on this ground, the Board went ahead anyway.
Days after his reappointment, the government issued a showcause notice to Sharma asking him to explain why he had not submitted his first-class bachelor degree, which was a prerequisite for the post of IIM Rohtak director, despite being asked to.
The recent development is a departure from the stand earlier taken by the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office on the issue. In 2015, while the MoE had advocated retaining government control in the name of ensuring financial and administrative propriety, the PMO had wanted a hands-off approach. The draft law went back and forth for almost a year‚Äî from October 2015 to September 2016 ‚Äî during which the Education Ministry stuck to its guns under Smriti Irani, but yielded after Prakash Javadekar took over in July 2016.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/to-have-say-in-key-iim-appointments-centre-set-to-appoint-president-as-visitor-8863377/,education
Marshall Middleton review: Loud with nuance,My first impression of the Marshall was simple ‚Äî loud and bass.,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too loud‚Ä¶,‚Äù my sleepy-eyed 12-year-old complains as I try to wake him up on a school day. He‚Äôs referring to the podcast I‚Äôm playing on Marshall Middleton in the living room. I am happy the speaker has done its job well and the fact is sitting just next to it I did not feel it was too loud. That‚Äôs the effect this compact Bluetooth speaker delivers effectively every time you play it.
The Middleton is a very Marshall-looking Bluetooth speaker. But it is more compact and portable than units I have seen from this brand before. The built quality is great with a gold finish speaker grill up front with the Marshall logo and another gold toggle on top which acts as the power button and lets you adjust volume and skip songs. On the left of this is an LED strip that shows the battery level and to the right are bass and treble controls. The gold looks great, but I would have preferred the black and not the cream, a colour I think will get soiled soon under Indian conditions.

Failed star is a record-breaking ‚ÄòJupiter‚Äô hotter than the Sun,"A newly-discovered ""hot-Jupiter"" has a surface temperature 2,000 degrees hotter than that of our Sun.","Hot Jupiters are curious cosmic bodies. They are kind of like our Jupiter but they orbit very close to their stars, sometimes completing an entire orbit in just weeks or even hours, meaning that they have extremely hot surface temperatures. A new hot Jupiter discovered by astronomers has a surface temperature 2,000 degrees hotter than that of our Sun.
In a study published in Nature Astronomy, scientists write on the discovery of a system that consists of two bodies located about 1,400 light-years away. This system offers an unprecedented opportunity to study hot Jupiter atmospheres in particular while also helping advance our understanding of planetary and stellar evolution, according to the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Although Salah has scored 17 goals in all competitions at the halfway mark this season, he has scored only seven in the Premier League where he has averaged nearly 24 goals a season during his time with Liverpool.

Scientists reveal physics behind stars‚Äô unusual ‚Äòsuperflares‚Äô,"Scientists have used computer models to understand how ""super flares"" on brighter stars than the Sun work.","Although it may look like a static ball of fire in the sky from our perspective, the Sun is very active and produces solar flares that can impact our planet. The strongest of these flares have the capacity to cause blackouts and disrupt communications on a global scale.
While solar flares are powerful by themselves, they are nothing compared to thousands of ‚Äúsuperflares‚Äù that are observed by NASA‚Äôs Kepler and TESS missions. These superflares are produced by stars that are 100 to 10,000 times brighter than the Sun.
The physics is believed to be the same between the solar flares on our sun and the superflares on other planets ‚Äî they are sudden releases of magnetic energy, But since the super-flaring stars have stronger magnetic fields, they have brighter flares. But the superflares have some unusual behaviorus‚Äî they have in initial short-lived enhancement followed by a secondary longer-duration but less intense flare.
ADVERTISEMENT
Scientists developed a model to explain the phenomenon, which was published in a paper in The Astrophysical Journal on Wednesday.
It was thought that the visible light in these flares only came from the lower layers of a star‚Äôs atmosphere. Particles that are energised by ‚Äúmagnetic reconnection‚Äù fall down from the hot corona (outer layer of the star) and heat these layers. But recent work put forward the hypothesis that the emission from coronal loops may also be detected for super-flaring stars but that their density in these loops would need to be extremely high for that.
Unfortunately, there was no real way to test this since we cannot really see those loops‚Äîhot plasma trapped by a star‚Äôs magnetic field‚Äîon stars other than our Sun. But other astronomers who were not part of the study spotted stars that had a peculiar light curve which was similar to a celestial ‚Äúpeak-bump,‚Äù or a jump in brightness. As it turned out, this light curve bore a resemblance to a solar phenomenon where a second more gradual peak follows the initial burst. It reminded the astronomers of a phenomenon on the Sun called late-phase flares.
This prompted the question ‚Äî could the same process produce similar late-phase brightness in visible light? The researchers answered that by adapting fluid simulations that had been frequently used to simulate solar flare loops and scaled up the loop length and magnetic energy. They found that the large flare energy input pumps a lot of mass into the loops. This resulted in dense, bright visible light emissions.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/solar-sun-star-super-flares-physics-9059879/,technology
"Randhawa and Bhullar lie tied 12th, seven Indians make cut in Oman","Randhawa shot 70 on the first day added 74 in the second round, while Bhullar has rounds of 72-72.","Veteran Jyoti Randhawa, who is over 50, is still going strong as he was the best placed Indian at tied 12th place alongside 10-time Asian Tour winner Gaganjeet Bhullar, at the halfway stage of the USD 2 million International Series Oman golf tournament here.

Bhullar began on the first and had a rocky front nine with two birdies and two bogeys within first six holes. He then played 12 pars in a row for 72.
Another up and coming Japanese player Ryo Hisatsune, who also competed in the morning, is one shot back after carding a 70. They were two of only nine players to break par on a truly testing day.

"Australian Open: Jannik Sinner can match Novak Djokovic in his game, but can he emulate the Serb‚Äôs appetite for the big stage?","Italian has beaten World No.1 in two their last three meetings, but the legend is usually at his best late in a Grand Slam.","For Novak Djokovic, hunting a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title, the biggest threat in the main draw of the Australian Open may not have been a rematch of his epic five-set Wimbledon final defeat to 20-year-old Spanish phenomenon Carlos Alcaraz. The highly-anticipated potential semifinal between Djokovic, the greatest tennis player on the big stage, and Jannik Sinner, the 22-year-old World No. 4 from Italy on an unparalleled hot streak, is now a reality, as well as a small headache for the World No. 1.
Friday‚Äôs semifinal has the potential to be a seminal moment in Sinner‚Äôs career. Not only is he in red-hot form ‚Äì he has won 18 of his last 19 matches and clinched two ATP titles and the Davis Cup since October ‚Äì but he has also defeated Djokovic twice in three meetings over 12 days at the back end of last year.
Sinner beat Djokovic in a three-set epic in their group-stage match at the ATP season-ender, but Djokovic got his revenge in the final. When they met in the Davis Cup the week after, Sinner prevailed in extraordinary fashion, saving two match points and making Djokovic unusually buckle under pressure.
Djokovic‚Äôs tendency to raise his level in big moments, Sinner‚Äôs form, and the pair‚Äôs three recent meetings only heighten the anticipation, and give plenty away regarding where this match can be won and lost.

Backhand mismatch
For so long has Djokovic used his backhand to flatten out opponents and isolate their weaknesses that he has increasingly relied on it as a comfortable rally option, which is not the case when facing the heaviest backhand on the tour.
Rev-for-rev, Sinner‚Äôs backhand is not only more powerful than most on tour, but it is an extremely versatile option from the baseline. Among the many improvements that have come in his game after he started working with coach Darren Cahill ‚Äì including an improved serve and better fitness ‚Äì baseline strategy has been refined more than anything else. The Italian uses his pure shot-making to push opponents into awkward positions and open up the court to put the ball away. His backhand down the line is the most useful option for winners, but his backhand crosscourt is the most useful rally weapon.

‚Äî #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 24, 2024
Djokovic fell for this in the first of their three meetings in November, allowing Sinner to dictate with his backhand crosscourt, contending but eventually succumbing to the power Sinner‚Äôs pure ball striking tends to create. He solved this problem in their next match that he won in the same week, bringing his forehand into play as an attacking strategy, and staying aggressive, not passive, from the baseline.
This match may well be defined by how much Djokovic is able to keep Sinner preoccupied on his forehand side, and how often the Serb goes for the gutsier backhand down-the-line as opposed to bashing it out in long crosscourt rallies.
Seizing key moments
ADVERTISEMENT
Many aspects of both their playing styles may make this match live up to the hype. Sinner is a pure ball striker, Djokovic can absorb pressure and turn defence into offence. Sinner has an improved serve, Djokovic is an elite returner. Sinner has superior athleticism and footspeed, Djokovic has greater variety.

Djokovic‚Äôs greatest strength is his appetite for the big stage. The Serb has been far from his best in Melbourne so far, so count on him to raise his level for a big match, and even when he is being outplayed, he will once again pull out all the stops to stay alive in a match and drag his opponent to pressure moments and wait for them to blink.
But during his burst of form in the past six months, Sinner has shown composure even under immense pressure. In five matches at the Australian Open so far, he has won 26 of the 28 break points he has faced. In the quarterfinal against Andrey Rublev, he won the second set tiebreaker despite trailing 2-5. Both his recent wins against Djokovic came after he was put under the pump ‚Äì the first in a deciding set tiebreak, and the second after being double match point down. According to the ‚ÄòUnder Pressure‚Äô leaderboard, official stats collected by the ATP say Sinner is the second-best player under pressure behind Djokovic, thanks in most part to him having saved 70 percent of break points he has faced.

Over Rs 9 crore: That‚Äôs what Ronaldo‚Äôs four-and-half-hours cost a Saudi company,"The Saudi-based company would get four-and-a-half hours with Ronaldo, comprising a photo-shoot, five signed shirts and two plugs across his social media channels.","Before joining Saudi club Al Nassr for an eyewatering ¬£173 million-a-year deal, Cristiano Ronaldo had cost a Saudi Arabia company around ¬£920,000 (INR 91,951,122) back in 2017 for four and a half hours of his time.
This is according to Der Spiegel journalists Rafael Buschmann and Michael Wulzinger‚Äôs book Football Leaks which uncovered how much it cost to hire one of the biggest names in the world, let alone football.
According to the book, a Saudi telecoms business Mobily had struck a deal with Ronaldo‚Äôs Irish image rights company, Multisports and Image Management. The Saudi-based company would get four-and-a-half hours with Ronaldo, comprising a photo-shoot, five signed shirts and two plugs across his social media channels, where he reportedly earns around ¬£1.6 million (INR 15,98,13,552) per sponsored post.
For all of these, Ronaldo and his representatives charged the company an a whopping amount of ¬£920,000. The company was allowed to use the photos taken on the day but as it was a regional company, the advertisements were limited to the Middle East and North African countries.
Meanwhile, Ronaldo on Saturday netted an incredible first-half hat trick for his side Al Nassr against Damac FC.
After just 18 minutes into the game, Ronaldo gave his team the lead with a goal from the penalty spot after Ibrahim Al Nakhli had been penalised for a handball inside the penalty area.
With a brilliantly executed left-footed drive into the goal, Ronaldo doubled his tally and gave his team a 2-0 lead within the next five minutes.

With that goal, Ronaldo has now scored 153 goals with his weak foot. In his last four games, he has scored seven goals and registered two assists.

Perseid meteor shower 2023: How to spot it in the sky or on live stream,Perseid meteor shower 2023: Here is how you can watch Perseids in the night sky or even through a live stream.,"The Perseid meteor shower, also known as the Perseids, is one of the brightest meteor showers that happen every year. This year, they should peak on the nights of August 13 and August 14, when you might get to see up to 100 meteors per hour. Here is everything you need to know about them and how you can spot them.
How to watch the Perseid meteor shower
The Perseids are named after the constellation Perseus. This is because the meteor shower‚Äôs radiant, or the direction from which it seems to originate, will lie in the same direction as Perseus. The Perseid meteor shower is considered the best meteor shower of the year with swift and bright meteors, according to NASA.
To get the best view of the meteor shower, find a place far away from the city lights with as little light pollution as possible. Once you reach there, look for the radiant of the meteor which should be near the Perseus constellation. You can use an AR sky map app like Photopills or others to help you do this. Some will help you identify the radiant itself directly. Once you have found the radiant, face in that direction, find a comfortable place to sit or lie down, and watch for meteors sparking up the sky.
ADVERTISEMENT
In case you are not able to see the meteor shower directly, you can also view it through the live stream from the Virtual Telescope Project below.
Where does the Perseid meteor shower come from
Meteor showers happen when the Earth passes through the trail of space debris left behind by a comet or other celestial bodies. The Perseids are caused by the debris from the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet takes about 133 years to orbit the Sun.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/perseid-meteor-shower-2023-how-to-watch-8884431/,technology

"AI cannot be patent ‚Äòinventor‚Äô, UK Supreme Court rules in landmark case","Stephen Thaler wanted to be granted two patents in the UK for inventions he says were devised by his ""creativity machine"" called DABUS.","A U.S. computer scientist on Wednesday lost his bid to register patents over inventions created by his artificial intelligence system in a landmark case in Britain about whether AI can own patent rights.
Stephen Thaler wanted to be granted two patents in the UK for inventions he says were devised by his ‚Äúcreativity machine‚Äù called DABUS.
His attempt to register the patents was refused by the UK‚Äôs Intellectual Property Office (IPO) on the grounds that the inventor must be a human or a company, rather than a machine.
ADVERTISEMENT
Thaler appealed to the UK‚Äôs Supreme Court, which on Wednesday unanimously rejected his appeal as under UK patent law ‚Äúan inventor must be a natural person‚Äù.
Judge David Kitchin said in the court‚Äôs written ruling that the case was ‚Äúnot concerned with the broader question whether technical advances generated by machines acting autonomously and powered by AI should be patentable‚Äù.
Thaler‚Äôs lawyers said in a statement that the ruling ‚Äúestablishes that UK patent law is currently wholly unsuitable for protecting inventions generated autonomously by AI machines and as a consequence wholly inadequate in supporting any industry that relies on AI in the development of new technologies‚Äù.
‚ÄòLEGITIMATE QUESTIONS‚Äô
A spokesperson for the IPO welcomed the decision ‚Äúand the clarification it gives as to the law as it stands in relation to the patenting of creations of artificial intelligence machines‚Äù.
ADVERTISEMENT
They added that there are ‚Äúlegitimate questions as to how the patent system and indeed intellectual property more broadly should handle such creations‚Äù and the government will keep this area of law under review.
Thaler earlier this year lost a similar bid in the United States, where the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office‚Äôs refusal to issue patents for inventions created by his AI system.
Giles Parsons, a partner at law firm Browne Jacobson, who was not involved in the case, said the UK Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling was unsurprising.
‚ÄúThis decision will not, at the moment, have a significant effect on the patent system,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because, for the time being, AI is a tool, not an agent.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúI do expect that will change in the medium term, but we can deal with that problem as it arises.‚Äù
Rajvinder Jagdev, an intellectual property partner at Powell Gilbert, said the ruling followed similar decisions by courts in Europe, Australia and the U.S. and has ‚Äúgiven certainty that inventors must be a natural person.‚Äù
But he added: ‚ÄúThe judgment does not preclude a person using an AI to devise an invention ‚Äì in such a scenario, it would be possible to apply for a patent provided that person is identified as the inventor.‚Äù
In a separate case last month, London‚Äôs High Court ruled that artificial neural networks can attract patent protection under UK law.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-cannot-be-patent-inventor-uk-supreme-court-rules-in-landmark-case-9076959/,technology

Innovative Teaching Methods in Indian Higher Education for Increasing Student Engagement,"At Manipal University Jaipur, we focus on experiential learning through research & projects and industry-based internships to make education effective, engaging and relevant.","Flexible, inclusive, and innovative teaching methods in the Indian education system are very much required to increase student engagement and improve overall learning outcomes. According to a survey, only 55% of students in a class are actively engaged in learning. Although this engagement level further took a blow with lockdowns during the Covid time.
According to a research paper published in Emerald Insight, engagement levels among students have been significantly affected by social isolation, uncertainties during the pandemic and their return to classrooms after almost two years of study-at from home. 
Remote learning could not retain students‚Äô attention for longer, and virtual classes disconnected empathy between faculty and students. The findings of the study also stated that this disconnects due to absence of physical interaction between faculty and students further hampered student engagement.
In this scenario, there is an urgent need to innovate teaching methods to increase student engagement. In a one-to-one chat with Dr Nitu Bhatnagar (Registrar, Manipal University Jaipur), she said, ‚ÄúStudent engagement is a crucial element of education. It improves the ability to retain information for a longer time. Students can analyse and interpret the learning better. Attentive classrooms make it manageable, improve commitment to education and reduce dropout rates significantly. At Manipal University Jaipur, we focus on experiential learning through research & projects and industry-based internships to make education effective, engaging and relevant.‚Äù
As per the NASSCOM Insights report in the FICCI-EYP Knowledge Report‚Äô Higher Education in India: Vision 2047‚Ä≤, India is experiencing a clear demand-supply gap in the digitally skilled workforce. In 2020, India‚Äôs demand for employees with digital skills was around 8x the size of the available talent pool. By 2024, the market for a digitally skilled workforce is projected to become 20x the available talent pool. Demand for digital roles is rising at a CAGR of 19.23%, while the professionals with digital skills are growing only by 16-20%.
A study says that progressive teaching methods help to improve engagement and boost employability and, therefore, can support filling this void to prepare India for the Digital Era or Web 3.0.
Heeding the need, universities and the Indian government have taken several steps to implement innovative and effective teaching methods. NEP 2020 is one of India‚Äôs most noteworthy educational reforms, which aims to improve teaching methods at par with global standards and ensure the overall growth of students.
ADVERTISEMENT
Dr Nitu Bhatnagar believes, ‚ÄúEducation should be fun, relevant and effective. It improves engagement and ensures the best learning outcomes. We organise various experiential learning exercises at MUJ to make education as engaging and effective as possible.‚Äù
Here are some recommended teaching methods to improve student‚Äôs engagement levels.
Flipped Classroom is a type of blended learning method. Students learn concepts at home through class recordings, live sessions, podcasts, etc., and practice at school.
Project-based Learning provides real-world experience. Students participate in practical projects, collaborate with a team and apply classroom learnings in a real workplace environment.
Peer Teaching and Mentoring is a type of collaborative learning. Students and teachers work and support each other, which helps with personal and academic development. This teaching method can be through various forms such as one-to-one, group, online, etc.
Gamification is an innovative teaching method with game elements like leaderboards, badges, point systems, etc., in a learning atmosphere to motivate learners. It improves students‚Äô attention span, inspires them to continue their education and boosts learning outcomes.
Active Learning Strategies improve students‚Äô engagement comparatively more than traditional methods. Examples are think-pair-share, experiential learning, cooperative learning, educational games, problem-based learning, peer instructions, role-playing, and more.
Technology Integration creates an equitable learning environment where students learn according to their pace. It is essential to develop digital skills and prepare for future job roles. Digital field trips, social media integration, gamification, creating digital content, reviewing and analysing web pages, live/recorded classes, etc., are ways to integrate tech into learning methods.
Flexible learning paths, reforms in assessment/evaluations, introduction of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary courses, dual programs, and guest lectures are crucial aspects to improve teaching methods.
ADVERTISEMENT
Dr Nitu Bhatnagar firmly believes in the magic of integrating experiential activities in pedagogy to improve engagement. She recalled Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs quote, ‚ÄúTell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn,‚Äù to establish her viewpoint to improve teaching methods and make it engage and student-centric.
She said, ‚ÄúWe at Manipal University, Jaipur, organise experiential activities and provide state-of-the-art infra and other opportunities for extra-curricular activities. MUJ offers world class indoor and outdoor sports facilities, health & fitness centres, 75+ students clubs and much more. Clubbing classroom learning with extra-curricular activities and experiential learning improves overall performance of the students in grades, and professional acumen.‚Äù
Another teaching method that‚Äôs trending these days, recognised by UNESCO and several universities globally, is the Ubuntu method of education. It originated in Africa and is based on the philosophy that ‚ÄòAll humanity is connected.‚Äô It is a humanist education method explored extensively in the International Review of Education ‚Äì Journal of Lifelong Learning by UNESCO. The Ubuntu teaching method implies that if all students are treated well and similarly, their performance improves.
The evolution of technology, changing socio-economic metrics, the coronavirus pandemic and other reasons necessitated the need to innovate and implement effective teaching methods that connect, improve engagement and multiply productivity. Implementing these teaching methods in pedagogy can enhance leadership skills and better prepare students for the world. However, it is also essential to assess the available resources and upgrade them to implement suitable new-age teaching methods if required.
Let‚Äôs conclude with the wise words of Yong Zhao, ‚ÄúThe new age survival skills are effective communication, critical-thinking skills, and curiosity. These are not optional but mandatory for all, not only for elites of the society.‚Äù Innovative teaching methods focusing on new-age skills and infotainment elements improve engagement and employability and boost the overall education system.

India‚Äôs chances in T20 WC will be largely dependent on top-order: Mithali,The legendary batter added that the Indian bowlers will have to show a marked improvement in testing conditions at the marquee event beginning on Friday in South Africa.,"Former skipper Mithali Raj feels India‚Äôs chances of winning the Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup will depend largely on the top order‚Äôs form.
The legendary batter added that the Indian bowlers will have to show a marked improvement in testing conditions at the marquee event beginning on Friday in South Africa.
‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs chances will be largely dependent on the top order. Smriti Mandhana is playing well and is a match winner,‚Äù Mithali wrote in her column for the ICC.
‚ÄúHarmanpreet Kaur has looked in good form too but we have to beat Australia and England you need others batters to come to the party.‚Äù The Indian team, which takes on Pakistan in their tournament opener on February 12 in Cape Town, have been playing in South Africa.
The Indian team, which recently finished runners up in a Tri series against hosts South Africa and West Indies, will be fielding a relatively inexperienced pace unit barring veteran Shikha Pandey.
‚ÄúThe bowling will be tested and that is where we need to see an improvement,‚Äù Mithali added.
The 40-year-old hopes the U19 World Cup-winning duo of Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh make use of the knowledge that they have gained while playing the age group tournament on these conditions.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúI hope Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh also have a good run at the World Cup considering they have gained so much experience of the conditions in South Africa.
‚ÄúI am excited about some of the young players coming through and there is definitely some talent in the Under-19s team which I had the chance to see play at the inaugural ICC Under-19s Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup.‚Äù
Australia favourites to win
Mithali opined defending champions Australia‚Äôs excellent batting department make them favourites to win the event for an unprecedented sixth time.
‚ÄúI think everyone would agree that Australia are the favourites, and deservedly so. I am expecting, tight, competitive matches.They are so difficult to beat because they bat deep and have an excellent batting line-up.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThere are not many teams who can rival them in terms of big hitters, and the fact they have numerous players who can play a similar role means that if one fails, others can step in.
However, Mithali feels India have a knack of producing their best against Australia.
‚ÄúWe saw recently that when they toured India although that was a very competitive series but when it came down to it, more often than not, it was Australia who came out on top.
‚ÄúWhile Australia are definitely favourites, we have seen India and England play some of their best cricket in the knockout stages of tournaments so I would not write them off.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúIndia also have the knack of bringing their best against Australia.‚Äù
WPL
The inaugural Women‚Äôs Premier League (WPL) will be played this year with the auction slated to be held on February 13 in Mumbai.
Mithali, who made significant contributions in popularising the women‚Äôs game during her 23-year long glorious career, feels franchise cricket will not only help the players become financially secure but also enable them to invest in their game.
‚ÄúWhat is great at this moment is that the women‚Äôs game is constantly evolving. Where 140 used to be a par score in a T20, now you can see 160-180 plus chased down, and so many matches go down to the wire.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThat change has come down to the increase of leagues all over the world, with the WBBL in Australia, the Super League in England and of course the Women‚Äôs Premier League in India which is going to start this year.
‚ÄúThose platforms not only give local players the chance to interact with overseas stars, but they also offer better financial stability which allows them to invest in their own games, hiring personal coaches or strength and conditioning coaches.
While Mithali, who retired last year, will not be playing in the league, she has been roped in as a mentor and advisor by Gujarat Giants.
‚ÄúI am not surprised at all that we have got to this point, the Women‚Äôs Premier League in India is a huge development.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWhile I will not be playing, I will be fortunate enough to serve as a mentor and advisor for the Gujarat Giants.
‚ÄúThere is no disappointment about the fact that I missed out on playing in it, my journey as a cricketer was different and I was able to play my part in the evolution of the sport.
She hopes the league will help in player development.

India‚Äôs long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings and the local-currency senior unsecured rating remains at Baa3, while the other short-term local-currency rating stands at P-3, it said.

"Animal actor Saloni Batra defends college shootout scene, believes ‚Äòthat does not happen in real life‚Äô","Animal actor Saloni Batra said that the audience should not have only negative takeaways from the film, and added that filmmakers cannot preach.","While Ranbir Kapoor‚Äôs Animal has found success at the box office, it has faced criticism for its portrayal of toxic masculinity and misogyny.

"‚ÄòIf Mukesh Ambani was an actor, no one will cast him as a rich industrialist‚Äô: Pankaj Tripathi feels ‚Äòcinema has created stereotypes‚Äô","Pankaj Tripathi mentioned in a recent interview that in cinema, people tend to box actors into particular roles based on their looks.","Actor Pankaj Tripathi has been playing all his roles with utmost perfection, be it that of a criminal in Mirzapur and Gangs of Wasseypur or that of an emotional father in Bareilly Ki Barfi and Gunjan Saxena. All his roles, to this day, have been based in the heartland of the country and the audience has barely seen him as a royal or a rich character. But this is not by choice. Tripathi believes he is equally capable of acing a ‚Äúposh‚Äù role if given an opportunity. However, he mentioned in a recent interview that in cinema, people tend to stereotype and box actors into particular roles based on their looks.
While interacting with ANI, Tripathi insisted on ‚Äòchanging the perspective of cinema‚Äô. He said, ‚ÄúIn cinema, we have made a stereotype that a doctor looks like this, an engineer looks like that. During auditions, a brief is written even for the junior artists like ‚Äòrich look, corporate look‚Äô.

Generative AI hype to fade in 2024? Four bold AI predictions,CCS Insight's report suggests a reality check for generative AI. Are the costs and risks catching up with the hype?,"The hype surrounding AI technology has continued well into 2023 following the initial explosion in interest in ChatGPT when it was released in November 2022. And with new and exciting products and features being launched almost every week, it‚Äôs understandable why the hype has kept up.
However a new report by CCS Insight ‚Äì a global technology research firm ‚Äì has suggested that generative AI will face a reality check in 2024 when awareness about sustaining the running costs and mitigating associated risks will rise. The report has also predicted that an arrest for the first AI-based identity fraud will be made next year.
Intrigued? Let‚Äôs take a look at the top predictions.
ADVERTISEMENT
#1: Generative AI will face a reality check
Generative AI models including OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude have shown impressive capabilities in generating realistic and engaging content. Still, they also require massive amounts of computing power and data to train and run.
These colossal requirements may come home to roost in 2024. CCS Insight predicts that generative AI will face a reality check next year, as the hype around it will be replaced by the awareness of the cost, risk, and complexity involved in deploying and sustaining it.
Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC that generative AI is overhyped and there are many obstacles that need to be overcome to bring it to market. He pointed out that only a few large companies can afford to design and use their own specialised AI chips to run generative AI models, while many other organisations and developers will find it too expensive.
#2: EU‚Äôs AI regulation plans may face turbulence
At the same time, the European Union, which has been at the forefront of regulating AI and setting the benchmark for regulatory bodies around the world, will actually find it hard to keep up with the technicalities of the fast-growing industry.
ADVERTISEMENT
CCS Insight predicts that the EU AI regulation will encounter difficulties and will have to be revised and redrawn multiple times due to the fast pace of AI development. Currently, work is underway to pass the AI Act, a piece of regulation that would finally put under check the unfettered growth of AI. It‚Äôs set to ban tech like live facial recognition altogether.

#3: AI content warnings will become common
AI-generated content is becoming more prevalent and accessible on the internet, but it also poses challenges for verifying its authenticity and quality. AI-generated content can be used for various purposes, such as entertainment, education, marketing, or misinformation. However, some AI-generated content may contain factual errors or biases that can mislead or harm users.
CCS Insight predicts that a search engine will soon add content warnings to alert users that material they are viewing from a certain web publisher is AI-generated rather than made by people. The analysts said that this will be similar to how social media platforms added information labels to posts related to Covid-19 to combat misinformation about the virus. They said that this will be a necessary step to ensure trust and transparency in the online information landscape.
#4: AI-based identity fraud will lead to arrests
AI can also be used to impersonate someone‚Äôs identity, either through voice synthesis or deepfake technology. Voice synthesis is a type of generative AI that can create realistic audio clips of someone‚Äôs voice based on their speech samples. Deepfake is a type of generative AI that can create realistic video clips of someone‚Äôs face or body based on their image or video samples. These technologies can be used for various applications, such as entertainment, education, or security. However, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as fraud, blackmail, or harassment.
ADVERTISEMENT
CCS Insight predicts that police will make their first arrest of a person who uses AI to impersonate someone in 2024. The analysts said that this will be a new form of identity fraud that will exploit the vulnerability of people‚Äôs online identities. They said that this will require new methods of detection and prevention to protect people from being victimised by AI-based identity fraud.
As we enter 2024, we can expect to see more developments and debates around the future of AI and its impact on various domains. CCS has a clean track record when it comes to predictions, but of course, it‚Äôd be wise to take things with a pinch of salt, especially considering the fact that the AI landscape is such a rapidly evolving one.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/4-bold-ai-predictions-for-next-year-report-8976735/,technology

Kastoori movie review: A reality check about caste and class,Kastoori movie review: Director Vinod Kamble does not point the finger at casteism and class discrimination overtly. But their impact in creating social barriers and inequalities is evident.,"What‚Äôs striking about Kastoori is the underlying dreaminess. Even though the movie takes an unpretentious and unflinching look at an underprivileged school-going boy‚Äôs struggle to continue his education, the movie rarely shows him giving up hope. This dreaminess is at times expressed through the soothing background score but mostly through the undying optimism and smiles of Gopi (Samarth Sonawane).
Gopi is engaged in manual scavenging, cleaning toilets, and assisting in performing autopsies while his father spends most of his time at a local bar. In spite of being a bright student, Gopi is forced to choose between education and work since he has to contribute to his family‚Äôs income. With the help of soap and attar, Gopi tries to get rid of the smell that he fears he carries after all the scavenging and cleaning work. Gopi, prodded by his best friend (Shravan Upalakar), dreams of kastoori (musk) that will take away the odoriferous proof of his harsh life as well as class.

Retired telescope found 7 superhot exoplanets orbiting the same star,Data from NASA's retired Kepler space telescope helped scientists discover seven scorching hot planets orbiting the same star.,"NASA‚Äôs Kepler space telescope retired from duty in 2018, but the data it collected continues to yield scientific treasures. A team of researchers continuously studying data from the Kepler discovered seven searing hot planets orbiting one star. Each of them gets more radiant heat from their star per area than any planet in our solar system.
All the planets in the Kepler-385 system are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. It is one of the few systems known to host more than six verified planets or even planet candidates. At its centre, there is a star a lot like the Sun, except it is 10 per cent larger and 5 per cent hotter. The two inner planets are both slightly larger than Earth, but scientists believe they could be rocky and might even have a thin atmosphere.

Netflix just made liking/disliking content on smartphones easier,Netflix's new rating feature is available for iOS devices and will be extended to Android devices soon.,"Netflix has announced a new way to express preferences for its shows on smartphones. iPhone users can now provide feedback through a thumbs up, a double thumbs up, or even a thumbs down while watching movies or web series. Currently available for iOS, this feature will soon be extended to Android devices.
Netflix introduced this updated thumbs-up/down rating system on its platform back in 2017, replacing the previous five-star rating system. The rating system underwent another revamp in 2022, with the addition of a double thumbs-up option. iPhone and iPad users can now update their Netflix app to rate content while watching it. Similarly, non-iOS users can still utilise these ratings while browsing content.
Netflix intends to use these ratings to enhance its algorithm and provide personalised content recommendations to users. A single thumbs up typically indicates ‚ÄúI like it,‚Äù while a double thumbs up conveys ‚ÄúI love this!‚Äù Conversely, a thumbs down signals ‚ÄúNot for me.‚Äù

Salman Khan teaches democracy to Indians (and Pakistanis) in Tiger 3. Let that sink in,"The idea that the latest Salman Khan film is entirely based on the idea that democracy needs to be protected against people who declare themselves to be the sole custodian of the society, makes you hopeful for the future of Indian movies.","What if someone told you that the latest Salman Khan actioner can give you a ready reckoner on why democracy is better than dictatorship? Maneesh Sharma‚Äôs Tiger 3 is not just the popcorn-and-patriotism entertainer you always expected it to be, the latest Bhai film also expounds the idea that democracy needs to be protected against people who declare themselves to be the sole custodians of the country, making you hopeful for the future of Indian movies.
For many decades now, star-driven action films in India have been all about seeking revenge. It could be for the death of the hero‚Äôs beloved, or any other woman; it could be some childhood trauma that has scarred him for life and he is now looking for comeuppance; or, it could be all about seeking retribution for one‚Äôs country. The last one has been frequently revisited in our films and has appealed to the masses. The idea of patriotism, however, has changed a fair bit in our movies and in 2023, this was particularly evident. The year started with Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs Pathaan where a Pakistani agent, played by Deepika Padukone, had the crowd cheering for her when she joined forces with SRK‚Äôs Indian agent to save humanity. A few months later, in Jawan, Shah Rukh gave a rousing monologue where he spoke directly to his fans about the importance of voting for the right candidate. The film did not shy away from taking shots at the corrupt troika of bureaucracy, politics and business. And the year ended with Salman Khan in Tiger 3 where his main mission was to save Pakistan from the evils of dictatorship.
Tiger 3 is an Indian film with an Indian hero at the center of its story but strangely enough, India has no stake in the story of this film. The many times when Tiger is asked as to why he cares about what‚Äôs happening in Pakistan, he comes up with a rather flimsy excuse, a reason he repeats many times in the film. It makes you wonder why Maneesh and Salman zeroed in on this subject for the third Tiger installment. In the film, the protagonist asks his crew, who are stand-ins for the audience, a question that immediately tells you about the central idea of this film. ‚ÄòDemocracy or dictatorship?‚Äô asks Tiger and his crew responds in unison, ‚Äòdemocracy.‚Äô
ADVERTISEMENT
Salman Khan in a still from Tiger 3.
It is a rather strong statement when one of the most successful movie producing studios in the country decides to make a film where a choice as simple as this, at least for Indians who have been living in a democracy for over 75 years, needs to be reminded to the audience. The makers actually had to spell out why the need to have fair elections is essential and why democracy is better than having a dictator, the villain of this story, who might pretend to have good intentions. They underline that complete control in the hands of one person can‚Äôt be good for the health of a nation.
Tiger 3 also makes you wonder why, despite being set in Pakistan where an Indian agent is saving their democracy, there is no sense of superiority from any of the Indian characters? Our extremely loud news channels like to compare the two nations often and even before watching one of those shrill shows, you can presume that it‚Äôs all going to be about how India is better than its neighbour in the west. Tiger 3 gets an opportunity to do this many times over, yet chooses to walk away from it. Salman doesn‚Äôt break into a monologue telling Pakistanis how they should learn from India and its democracy, and the film does not suggest that saving Pakistan‚Äôs democracy will benefit India in any way. Was it because the writers and director felt that there was no need for this level of pettiness, or because they wanted their audience to actually think about the importance of democracy in a rapidly changing society?

By any measure, Tiger 3 is not a great film. The filmmaking is inept, the visual effects are laughable, the storytelling is convoluted and Salman can‚Äôt summon the charisma that makes his fans swoon, but, despite all of that, Tiger 3 makes a statement that many of its contemporaries would shy away from. Bollywood is often criticised for being apolitical or swaying the way political wind is blowing, but decades from now, when the cinema of 2023 is examined again, this sense of dissent from something as mainstream as Tiger 3 won‚Äôt go unnoticed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/opinion-entertainment/salman-khan-teaches-democracy-to-indians-and-pakistanis-in-tiger-3-let-that-sink-in-9101724/,entertainment

Japan launches antimonopoly probe into Google‚Äôs search dominance,"It is also looking into Google's practice of making Android phone makers install its ""Google Search"" and ""Google Chrome"" browser application with the ""Google Play"" app.","Japan‚Äôs competition watchdog said on Monday it has started investigating Google for a possible breach of antimonopoly laws in web search services, following similar steps by authorities in Europe and other major economies.
The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) said it was investigating whether Google violated Japan‚Äôs Antimonopoly Act by returning part of its revenue to Android smartphone makers on the condition they not install rival search engines.
It is also looking into Google‚Äôs practice of making Android phone makers install its ‚ÄúGoogle Search‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoogle Chrome‚Äù browser application with the ‚ÄúGoogle Play‚Äù app.

‚ÄúThere is suspicion that through these steps it is excluding competitors‚Äô business activity and restricting its business partners‚Äô business activity in the search services market,‚Äù a JFTC official told a press conference.

A violent killing, in which Dasru is made to participate, is the catalyst for their flight.

India vs England: Can Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer fill the void left by Virat Kohli?,"IND vs ENG: In Kohli‚Äôs absence, it‚Äôs even important for them to shoulder responsibility and score big runs","On Tuesday, Shubman Gill was named India‚Äôs men cricketer of 2023. On Wednesday, a day before India‚Äôs first Test against England, he turned up for a full-on nets session at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. It‚Äôs a rare sight because most first-eleven regulars skip the match-eve practice session. Mostly, only the back-ups turn up, more in the hope of an opportunity opening up at the last minute.
But few batsmen in India‚Äôs line-up, weakened by the absence of Virat Kohli, would be as under pressure as Gill could be. So he slogged for a good couple of hours in the nets under the unusually searing January sun. After starting off against seamers, he quickly shifted to facing the spinners (all net bowlers). Having struggled in the past against off-spinners, he would seek one out and instruct him to bowl a bit slower through the air as he alternated between attack and defence. There were times when he was beaten on the outside edge. Gill would often respond with an aggressive shot.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-can-gill-and-iyer-fill-the-virat-void-9125985/,sports

Wembley Stadium, which seats 90,000 spectators, will have standing areas behind each goal, with 867 seats available to both clubs‚Äô fans in the East and West Stands.
Grounds in England‚Äôs top divisions were converted to all-seater stadiums nearly 30 years ago after Liverpool supporters were crushed in over-crowded and fenced-in areas at the Hillsborough Stadium in 1989, which led to 97 deaths.
‚ÄúIn these areas, fans are allowed to stand for matches in allocated spaces behind a barrier or a rail which prevents them from falling forward,‚Äù the EFL said in a statement.
‚ÄúIn all other areas of the stadium supporters must remain seated.‚Äù
The decision follows a trial where clubs like Cardiff City, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur offered licensed standing in designated seated areas for home and away fans.

"Zee, Sony yet to agree on merger conditions as deadline for extended negotiation nears",The two parties are yet to come to an agreement over Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) MD and CEO Punit Goenka leading the merged entity after Sony expressed concerns after market regulator Sebi barred him from holding managerial posts in Zee and any of the entities in a fund-diversion case.,"The fate of the USD 10 billion merger between Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Culver Max Entertainment, formerly Sony Pictures Networks India, is hanging by a thread, with the two parties unable to finalise an agreement as the end of the one-month grace period looms.
The two parties are yet to come to an agreement over Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) MD and CEO Punit Goenka leading the merged entity after Sony expressed concerns after market regulator Sebi barred him from holding managerial posts in Zee and any of the entities in a fund-diversion case.
Though the Securities and Exchange Board of India order was stayed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, Sony is not comfortable with Goenka leading the merged entity due to the stringent corporate governance policy in Japan. The contentious issue is not just over Goenka leading the merged entity, but the completion of the deal also depends on how the Indian firm is able to meet the other closing conditions, said an industry source.
ADVERTISEMENT
The deal, which was signed between Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures Networks India in 2021, has a stipulated period of two years in which the merger was to be completed before December 21, 2023, including regulatory and other approvals with a grace period of one month to complete the transaction.

By January 21, the one-month grace period for extended negotiations will end. Comments from Sony and ZEEL could not be obtained.
According to reports, the bone of contention is the driving seat of the merged entity. As per the agreed terms and conditions, Goenka was to lead the merger entity.
However, Culver Max Entertainment Pvt Ltd (CMEPL) is insisting on making way for its Sony Pictures Network head NP Singh.
ADVERTISEMENT
On December 17, the Subhash Chandra family promoted firm sought an extension of the December 21, 2023, deadline from Sony Group Corporation (SGC) firm Culver Max Entertainment and Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd (BEPL) under the Merger Cooperation Agreement dated December 22, 2021.
Earlier, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) stated that it has not yet agreed to a deadline extension requested by ZEEL for their merger proposed USD 10-billion merger. However, a day after it agreed to discuss the matter. The proposed USD 10-billion merger of ZEEL, BEPL and CMEPL has already received regulatory approvals from the fair trade regulator CCI, bourses NSE and BSE, shareholders and creditors of the company.
In August this year, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also gave a go-ahead to the merger of ZEEL and Culver Max Entertainment.
ADVERTISEMENT
This followed an interim order by Sebi barring Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd MD and CEO Punit Goenka from holding the position of a director or key managerial personnel in any listed company. The market regulator took action after they were found diverting funds from the company.
Chandra and Goenka moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) challenging the Sebi interim order. In October, SAT quashed the Sebi interim order.
Earlier in September 2021, then Sony Pictures Networks India and ZEEL entered into a non-binding term sheet to bring together their linear networks, digital assets, production operations and programme libraries. The combined entity will own over 70 TV channels, two video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV) and two film studios (Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India), making it the largest entertainment network in India.
Subsequently, the two parties signed a definitive agreement for their merger in December 2022. The majority of the board of directors of the combined entity would be nominated by the Sony Group and include the current SPNI Managing Director and CEO NP Singh.
However, questions over the future of the merger arose after Sebi‚Äôs actions against Chandra and Goenka for siphoning off funds of ZEEL.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/zee-sony-merger-deadline-negotiation-9100653/,business

"ATF prices hiked by 5% to highest this year, may push up airfares in festive season","With the latest price hike, jet fuel is now priced at Rs 1,18,199.17 per kilolitre (kl) in Delhi, Rs 1,10,592.31 per kl in Mumbai, Rs 1,26,697.08 per kl in Kolkata, and Rs 1,22,423.92 per kl in Chennai.","Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices for domestic airlines have been hiked by 5 per cent to their highest levels this year. The monthly price hike, the fourth straight one due to the spurt in international prices of crude oil and jet fuel, is expected to put additional pressure on airlines and might result in higher airfares during the upcoming festival season that usually sees a surge in travel demand.
ATF, or jet fuel, is the single-biggest cost for airlines and for Indian carriers, it accounts for over 40 per cent of their operational expenses. Jet fuel prices have risen by over 32 per cent since June and the current price levels are the highest since November of last year. Industry insiders suggest that travel demand in the festival season is seen as much higher than last year, while airlines have not been able to add capacity significantly. Given the situation, high jet fuel prices could force flyers to shell out even more.

Centre to soon notify rules for setting up GST appellate tribunals,"Russia had its refinery maintenance peak from mid-May and mid-June, which lowered that country‚Äôs crude oil consumption and triggered an upswing in oil exports, mainly to India.","India‚Äôs import of discounted Russian crude oil is likely to have peaked in June and could be headed for a month-on-month decline in July, marking the first instance of sequential fall in almost a year, as per estimates by commodity market analytics and intelligence firm Kpler.
According to Viktor Katona, Kpler‚Äôs Lead Crude Analyst, a decline in oil production in Russia and a higher demand pull from Russian refineries is expected to result in slightly lower dispatches to India. There are also expectations of a slight contraction in demand from Indian refiners in July and August as a few units would be under maintenance shutdowns during the monsoon, as the rainy season usually marks a dip in India‚Äôs oil demand.
In June, Indian refiners imported 2.17 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian crude, accounting for a little over 45 per cent of India‚Äôs total oil imports of 4.78 million bpd for the month, an analysis of Kpler data showed. The average daily quantity of Russian oil imported into India in June was marginally higher than the previous peak of 2.15 million bpd in May.
ADVERTISEMENT
From being a marginal player in India‚Äôs oil trade before the war in Ukraine, Russia is now New Delhi‚Äôs biggest source of crude oil. And for Moscow, India is now the biggest consumer of seaborne Russian crude oil. Indian refiners started snapping up Russian oil soon after the latter‚Äôs February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as Russia started offering deep discounts on its oil.
India‚Äôs Russian crude imports in June were more than the cumulative oil import volumes from at least the next four biggest suppliers‚ÄìIraq, Saudi Arabia, United States, and United Arab Emirates. For the second month running, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) beat private sector major Reliance Industries (RIL) as India‚Äôs biggest importer of Russian crude.
July, however, is expected to mark the first instance of a sequential fall in India‚Äôs Russian oil imports since August of last year. Kpler estimates 2 million bpd as the sustainable peak of India‚Äôs consumption of Russian oil. India‚Äôs overall refining capacity stands at around 5 million bpd and the country, while being the third-largest consumer of crude oil globally, depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement of the commodity.
‚ÄúWe believe India‚Äôs imports of Russian crude will see a slight downward correction to 2 million bpd, which will be the sustainable level of buying that disregards whatever domestic dynamics Russian producers are facing,‚Äù Katona told The Indian Express. According to him, the nearly 2.20 million bpd of Russian oil imported by Indian refiners in May as well as June was ‚Äúreally a one-off event‚Äù driven by maintenance of Russian refineries during the period.
ADVERTISEMENT
Russia had its refinery maintenance peak from mid-May and mid-June, which lowered that country‚Äôs crude oil consumption and triggered an upswing in oil exports, mainly to India.
However, the Russian refineries are now out of maintenance and are consuming a total of around 5.6 million bpd of crude oil, up from around 5 million bpd during the peak maintenance season. Additionally, Russia‚Äôs overall crude oil production has also seen some decline and is unlikely to rise notably, given that Moscow will have to stick to its agreed production targets as part of the coordinated output action by OPEC+ group of major oil producing nations.
 The next round of refinery maintenance works in Russia is expected in September-October, and Katona believes that there could be another upswing in Russian oil supplies to India during that period. By then, the planned maintenance works at Indian refineries during the ongoing monsoon season are also expected to be completed, which means that India‚Äôs oil demand should be at normal levels at the time.
ADVERTISEMENT
 Over the past two-three months, industry watchers and experts have been indicating that India appears to be testing its limits of Russian oil imports. Apart from the factors already mentioned, another key reason is the soft limit placed by Indian refiners‚Äô purchase commitments for sour grades of crude under term contracts with their traditional suppliers in West Asia.
 The medium-sour grade Urals crude has been the mainstay of India‚Äôs Russian oil imports. West Asian nations have traditionally been India‚Äôs major suppliers of sour crudes, and a considerable portion of these supplies are under annual term contracts, which have minimum purchase commitments. Most of the Russian oil, on the other hand, is being bought by Indian refiners on spot basis. This essentially means that the extent to which Urals can replace other sour crudes is limited by Indian refiners‚Äô minimum offtake commitments under term deals.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/commodities/after-hitting-fresh-high-in-june-indias-russian-oil-imports-may-decline-in-july-8699762/,business

Sony doubles down on virtual production business using its hardware muscle,"In recent decades Sony has shed struggling electronics lines to focus on games, movies and music but still makes hardware such as movie cameras.","Sony Group is increasing its focus on the virtual production business where it is seeing market-beating growth, a company executive said, riding on the strength of the Japanese entertainment conglomerate‚Äôs technology.

"IISc Bengaluru stops Teesta Setalvad‚Äôs entry for communal harmony talk, allows event post intervention","Students from other colleges who were invited for the discussion were turned away by the institution. Later around 45 attendees including faculty members and students of IISc, participated in the discussion.","The Indian Institute of Science (IISc ), Bangalore stopped civil rights activist and journalist Teesta Setalvad from entering the institution ahead of her talk on Communal Harmony and Justice, scheduled on Wednesday at 5 pm.
The discussion was organised by ‚ÄòBreak The Silence‚Äô, a student group in IISc. According to members of Break The Silence, permission was sought from the registrar of IISc for the event to be held at the CCS Seminar Hall. However, on the day of the event, with no intimation or notice, the institution directed the security personnel to stop Setalvad from entering the campus, minutes before the event, alleged the student group.
Later, faculty members of IISc intervened, challenging the denial of entry to Setalvad. Only after their intervention was Setalvad allowed to enter the institution.

However, the discussion did not take place as planned in the seminal hall. The venue was moved to Sarvam Complex near the cafeteria and the discussion began at around 5:45 pm and went on till 8 pm.
In fact, students from other colleges who were invited to the discussion were turned away by the institution. Later around 45 attendees including faculty members and students of IISc, participated in the discussion.
The discussions revolved around topics such as evolving riot patterns, the challenges harmony, scientific rationality pose to certain ideologies, and the utilisation of social media for spreading hate. Setalvad is the secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), an organisation formed to advocate for the victims of 2002 Gujarat riots. In June 2022, she was arrested by the Anti Terrorism Squad of Gujarat Police for allegedly conspiring to implicate the Gujarat government functionaries in the 2002 Gujarat Riots. However, the Supreme Court granted her interim bail on the ground that she was a woman, leaving the decision of regular bail to the Gujarat High Court after which she was released from jail.

Premier League accuses Manchester City of financial breaches,City are alleged to have breached rules relating to the provision of accurate financial information.,"The Premier League has referred Manchester City to an independent commission over more than 100 alleged breaches of finance rules since the club were acquired by the Abu Dhabi-based City Football Group.
League rules state that charges such as those faced by City could, if proved, result in a club being expelled from the Premier League in the worst-case scenario.
Offending clubs may alternately be deducted points, fined, or reprimanded.
City‚Äôs alleged breaches stretch from the 2009-10 season to the 2017-18 campaign, the league said on Monday.
The club, who were acquired by City Football Group in 2008, are also charged with failing to cooperate with and assist the Premier League in its investigation, which was launched in December 2018.
City are alleged to have breached rules relating to the provision of accurate financial information, ‚Äúin particular with respect to its revenue (including sponsorship revenue), its related parties and its operating costs,‚Äù the league said.
The club, who have won the Premier League title six times since the Abu Dhabi takeover, said they were surprised by the league‚Äôs ‚Äúissuing of these alleged breaches‚Äù.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThe club welcomes the review of this matter by an independent commission, to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position,‚Äù City added.
The charges stem from a Premier League investigation into City‚Äôs financial dealings launched four years ago, after the release of a tranche of ‚ÄúFootball Leaks‚Äù documents obtained by the German publication Der Spiegel and reviewed by Reuters.
SUBSEQUENT BAN
City were subsequently banned from the Champions League by European governing body UEFA for two years, but successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which overturned the ban in 2020.
The club were fined 30 million euros ($32.28 million) by UEFA, which CAS reduced to 10 million euros.
ADVERTISEMENT
In addition to the charges relating to the club‚Äôs revenue and operating costs, City are also alleged to have not fully disclosed managerial remuneration from the 2009-10 to 2012-13 seasons, when Roberto Mancini was manager.
The club are also charged with failing to comply with Premier League‚Äôs rules requiring clubs to follow UEFA‚Äôs financial fair play (FFP) regulations from the 2013-14 to 2017-18 seasons and failing to follow the Premier League‚Äôs rules on profit and sustainability from the 2015-16 to 2017-18 seasons.
FFP regulations are designed to stop clubs running up big losses through spending on players. They also ensure sponsorship deals are based on their real market value and are genuine commercial agreements ‚Äî and not ways for owners to pump cash into a club to get around the rules.
‚ÄúThe members of the Commission will be appointed by the independent Chair of the Premier League Judicial Panel,‚Äù the Premier League said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThe proceedings before the Commission will‚Ä¶ be confidential and heard in private.

Rupee settles 1 paisa higher at 83.37 against US dollar,RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to begin its three-day deliberations on December 6. Das would unveil the decision of the six-member MPC on December 8.,"The rupee recovered from all-time low levels to settle up by 1 paisa at 83.37 against the US dollar in a restricted trade on Tuesday amid a stronger American currency in overseas markets and disappointing services sector data.
Forex traders said the rupee traded in a narrow range as positive domestic markets and crude oil prices trading below the USD 80 per barrel mark cushioned the downside.
At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at its all-time low level of 83.41 against the greenback.

The local unit oscillated between an intra-day low of 83.41 and a high of 83.37 against the greenback and finally settled at 83.37 (provisional) against the dollar, higher by 1 paisa from its previous close, even as domestic benchmark indices touched new lifetime peaks.
On Monday, the rupee settled at 83.38 against the US dollar despite domestic benchmark stock indices rallying to lifetime high levels.
‚ÄúWe expect Rupee to trade with a slight negative bias on positive US dollar and weak global markets. However, expectations of fresh foreign fund inflows and a weak tone in crude oil prices may support rupee at lower levels,‚Äù said Anuj Choudhary, Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.
Traders may take cues from US ISM services PMI and JOLTS job openings data. Investors may remain cautious ahead of RBI‚Äôs monetary policy decision later this week. USDINR spot price is expected to trade in a range of 83.10 to 83.70, Choudhary said.

The Reserve Bank is likely to maintain the status quo on the short-term interest rate in its monetary policy review later this week.
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to begin its three-day deliberations on December 6. Das would unveil the decision of the six-member MPC on December 8.
Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback‚Äôs strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.07 per cent lower at 103.63. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, recovered 0.76 per cent to USD 78.62 per barrel.

On the domestic equity market front, Sensex surged 431.02 points, or 0.63 per cent, to settle at its all-time high of 69,296.14 points. The Nifty advanced 168.30 points, or 0.81 per cent, to hit its lifetime high of 20,855.10 points.
Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital market on Monday as they purchased shares worth Rs 2,073.21 crore, according to exchange data.
On the domestic macroeconomic front, the services sector growth in India fell to a one-year low in November on softer expansions in new work intakes and output, despite receding price pressures, a monthly survey said on Tuesday.

"India-UK FTA: Final push for deal as window closing fast, with poll MCC a line-in-the-sand","While the UK has asked India to reduce duty on cars and whisky among other items, India has sought better access for its service sector workforce in the UK. The final deal could see India lower duty to a greater extent as India is a high tariff country.","Top government officials from both India and the UK are making a final push to close pending issues in a bid to seal a free trade agreement (FTA) that has been in the works for the last two years, and where the widow is seen as closing really fast. The model code of conduct (MCC), likely to be implemented next month, is being viewed as a final cutoff date, with hectic last-minute parleys being escalated to the highest level in the Indian government across ministries including commerce, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs to thrash out a final consensus, a government official said.
The FTA with the UK would be the first full fledged deal with a western country that would see deeper economic integration with a major global service sector leader. However, the window to sign the deal is fast closing with elections in both the countries this year. While the general election in the UK is expected in December this year, India‚Äôs general elections are likely to take place between April and May this year.
The UK FTA is crucial as it will serve as a template for trade deals with larger western trade partners such as the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Economic integration with the western countries through FTA assumes significance as the global supply chain is undergoing a reset after covid-19 and multinational companies globally are adopting a China plus one policy. Multilateral trade agreements such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) are also being negotiated in a bid to shift away from dependence on China.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúFor us (India) MCC is the cutoff. Our UK counterpart understands this and that is the reason their officials are here and meetings are ongoing with the highest level of the government across ministries including commerce ministry, department of economic affairs and ministry of external affairs,‚Äù the official said.
A delegation from the UK arrived in India on January 22.
‚ÄúAll chapters are closed but a handful of articles in a few chapters are remaining. It is a small basket now. Over 90 per cent of the deal has been closed. There have been several issues and chapters closed in the last three months,‚Äù the official added.
The MCC is a code containing general precepts for model behaviour during elections conducted by Election Commission (EC). It has an entire chapter on what the party in power can and cannot do once elections are announced which forbids use of official machinery and personnel for the political gains of the party in power.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hence, the spirit of MCC also requires the bureaucracy or any public servant to not engage or appear to engage in an activity that could work to the advantage of the party in power. Notably, the MCC is only a moral code and lacks any statutory backing, the EC, at best, can censure, advise or pull up the person found violating it.
With the date for MCC fast approaching, India is looking to close two other FTAs including the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the European Free Trade Association with the four nation bloc of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.
However, the comprehensive trade deal with Australia is likely to be taken up after the general elections as Australian negotiators are seeking access into India‚Äôs agricultural market, which is a sensitive sector for India.
ADVERTISEMENT
While the UK has asked India to reduce duty on cars and whisky among other items, India has sought better access for its service sector workforce in the UK. The final deal could see India lower duty to a greater extent as India is a high tariff country. The average tariff on goods imported from India into the UK is 4.2% but the average tariff in India on goods imported from the UK is 14.6%
Negotiations on cars and whisky have been contentious as Indian industry has been seeking greater access into the UK market too. Indian whisky manufacturers have said that the UK should ease its three year maturation rule, which acts as a barrier for Indian whisky brands seeking entry into the UK, and is seeking duty concessions in the auto sector, particularly in the EV segment.
India‚Äôs labour-intensive sectors are expected to see gains from the India-UK FTA, especially the textile sector. Indian textile exports face tariffs as high as 10% in the UK and a trade deal could put India on par with competition such as Bangladesh (which get LDC benefits), and revive textile exports. Meanwhile a greater integration in the services sector with the UK could help greater job creation in the fast growing industry.
India and the UK are also looking to sign a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) alongside the FTA that could improve UK‚Äôs investments into India. To resolve investor-state disputes under the new BIT faster, India is expected to move away from its 2016 model BIT approach that stressed on exhaustion of local remedies.
In FY2023, India‚Äôs merchandise exports to the UK were valued at $11.41 billion while imports stood at $8.96 billion.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-uk-fta-final-push-for-deal-as-window-closing-fast-9127471/,business

5 lows from the world of tech in 2023,"These controversies dominated the tech world in 2023, be it the firing and rehiring of OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman to the downfall of X (formerly Twitter).","There were highs, lows, and, well, a lot of drama in the tech world in 2023. Although companies like Apple and Microsoft have seen sky-high valuations, big tech was in the spotlight for a lot of wrong reasons. While regulatory clamped down on big tech companies over the abuse of market dominance continued, some used mass layoffs after being pressured by investors to scale down.
Below are five lows from the tech sector in 2023:
Economic uncertainty and over hiring during the pandemic boom, are among the most commonly cited reasons companies laid off their employees. (Image Source: FreePik)
Spate of tech layoffs: It seemed as if years of easy money and rock-bottom rates would never end, but there was a reversal in fortunes, and reality hit hard. The tech layoffs that accelerated through the second half of 2022 continued in 2023, with almost 240,000 jobs eliminated through the year as companies as large as Google, Amazon and Microsoft as well as smaller startups eliminated thousands of jobs. Many of them were forced to downsize staff, citing significant investments made in certain divisions with no clear path to recoup those long-term bets. Others were shown the door after companies were pressured to become as lean as possible following investor cutbacks. Even though layoffs continued in Silicon Valley, tech companies didn‚Äôt lose the opportunity to scoop up talent, especially in chip development, machine learning and AI. In fact, a data scientist is the most in-demand job on the market right now. More so, searches for generative AI jobs on job-hunting platforms like Indeed have increased by 4000%.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äôs exit and return: There was a moment of disbelief when Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, was abruptly fired by the board of directors of Silicon Valley‚Äôs hottest startup. The announcement of Altman‚Äôs departure was so hush-hush that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said his company, OpenAI‚Äôs biggest investor, had not been contacted before the big reveal. The next few days before Altman was reinstated as CEO had more twists than any prime-time TV soap opera. At one point, Altman even joined Microsoft to lead the company‚Äôs new advanced artificial intelligence division, though that didn‚Äôt last long either. But once Altman was brought back to OpenAI, most of the old board members who had fired him were out. The firing and rehiring of Altman, perhaps the most important person in tech at the moment, showcases the power dynamics and how egos are at play. His ouster from OpenAI and support for his restoration gave the Silicon Valley wunderkind, who is in his 30s, a new level of fame, instantly making him a household name. Even though Altman has been presented as the future of tech, at least in his public persona, his company has surely started the debate on how artificial intelligence could rule our lives ‚Äì negatively and positively.

The downfall of X (formerly Twitter): Over the past year, since billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, the social media platform has experienced a significant decline. Despite adopting a new marketing name, ‚ÄúX,‚Äù and appointing a new CEO, Twitter has faced challenges such as frequent outages, significant staff layoffs, a proliferation of fake news, confusing subscription services and substantial losses in advertising revenue, even as it reinstated accounts belonging to Alex Jones and Donald Trump. Meanwhile, competitors have rolled out rival platforms (or Twitter clones) such as Threads and Bluesky in the hope of capturing users still actively seeking to ‚Äúmicroblog‚Äù on pertinent issues. The truth is, Musk‚Äôs plan to bring Twitter back to its old glory hasn‚Äôt panned out; rather, it has gone downhill. Under Linda Yaccarino, the former advertising chief for NBCUniversal, Twitter has only become more chaotic. Drastic policy changes, the way Twitter handled disinformation about the violence in Israel-Palestine, and the platform‚Äôs business model are all contributing to the demise of this once-popular social network.

Slow growth of 5G: Years after glitzy campaigns with promises to revolutionise the telecom industry, 5G has been a major flop. As the year closed, experts and trade insiders started to open up about how 5G has not had as big an impact as many telecom operators and gear makers were hoping for. In fact, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù impact of 5G compared to its predecessors has been far less. 5G, from the very beginning, was hyped to bring in high-speed download speeds and lag-free gaming, but 4G was good enough for most people. However, in reality, most of the current use cases of 5G are less relevant to consumers and more aimed at the enterprise. You might already own a 5G phone, but nobody knows how it‚Äôs better than your previous phone. Does it significantly change the experience? Probably not. Video calls are still the same, and so are watching YouTube videos. The problem is how telecom companies promised use cases of 5G, such as cloud-streaming gaming, self-driving cars, and AR/MR headsets way before their mass adoption. And yet, all the marketing campaigns to promote 5G and its rollout have so far proven lukewarm. The low uptake of 5G and lack of monetization opportunities led to a blip in the 5G hype, and eventually a massive disappointment.

Apple-Masimo patent case: A patent infringement case has led to Apple pulling out two of the newest Apple Watch models, the Series 9 and Ultra 2, from retail shelves in the US. Its online store paused sales on December 21, and the watches were removed from Apple‚Äôs physical stores on December 24. The unprecedented move by Apple follows a ruling by the International Trade Commission in October that found several Apple Watches infringe on patents held by Masimo, a medical technology company in Irvine, California. This means Apple can no longer import and sell its newest Apple Watch models in the US ‚Äî at least temporarily. Apple has won many legal battles with smaller companies in the past, but this time around, Cupertino actually lost a patent case over the technology its smartwatches use to detect people‚Äôs pulse rate. To avoid a complete ban, Apple can cut a deal with Masimo to license its technology, or it could appeal to the Biden administration to reverse the ruling. Still, one wonders how a company as big and powerful as Apple reached this point. This case could have both financial and reputational blows to Apple, which has tried to stay away from controversies. In court, Masimo detailed how Apple poached its top executives, stole trade secrets, and infringed on Masimo‚Äôs patents before later releasing a watch with a pulse oximeter. Poaching of talent in big tech is a known secret (also a dark reality), but the Masimo-Apple patent case also reignites the debate on how smaller companies are at the forefront of innovating new technologies, sometimes being bought by bigger rivals or not ending up getting acknowledgement for inventing game-changing technologies.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/5-lows-from-the-world-of-tech-in-2023-9082134/,technology

"Mutual fund SIPs touch record high in August, RBI‚Äôs CRR move impacts debt AUMs: AMFI","Investors poured in a record Rs 15,813 crore in August through systematic investments plans (SIPs) route offered by mutual fund players, an industry body said on Monday.","Investors poured in a record Rs 15,813 crore in August through systematic investments plans (SIPs) route offered by mutual fund players, an industry body said on Monday.
The Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) also said there was a net outflow of Rs 25,872 crore from the income or debt oriented schemes in August.
Its chief executive N S Venkatesh told reporters that the Reserve Bank‚Äôs incremental cash reserve ratio (CRR) measure to suck out excess liquidity ‚Äúpartially impacted‚Äù the industry‚Äôs performance on the debt side as such schemes are looked at more from a treasury management perspective by banks as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
The previous monthly high of SIPs inflows was Rs 15,244 crore in the preceding month of July. Venkatesh said the overall assets under management (AUM) for SIPs were Rs 8.47 lakh crore at the end of August and a record 35 lakh new SIPs were started in the month.
Venkatesh said the record high SIP flows suggests that retail investors continue to invest in the market, and added that he expects the same trend to continue in the future as well on factors like strong economic growth which will help market sentiment.
The overall AUM for retail investors‚Äô bets on equity and hybrid schemes was at Rs 24.38 lakh crore across 12.30 crore portfolios as at end-August.
There was also a record 19.58 lakh SIPs discontinued or matured in August, Venkatesh said, adding the same stood at over 17 lakh in July.
ADVERTISEMENT
The MF industry‚Äôs overall AUM grew to Rs 46.93 lakh crore in August, as against Rs 46.37 lakh crore in July.
In an SIP, an individual invests at periodic intervals like once a month starting from Rs 500 onwards. The 43-player industry has a high reliance on SIP flows.
Meanwhile, Venkatesh said the dip in debt AUMs does not point to any trend as it can be the result of the ongoing treasury operations.
ADVERTISEMENT
There was a Rs 348 crore fall in large cap schemes‚Äô AUMs, Venkatesh said, adding that he expects a reversal in it soon and the same will be driven by higher earnings growth.
He asserted that the continuing interest in small and mid-cap equity schemes ‚Äì they showed growth of Rs 4,264 crore and Rs 2,512 crore, respectively in August ‚Äì is not an ‚Äúirrational exuberance‚Äù by investors, and pointed out to a 60 per cent dip in asset prices which investors seem to be looking at while taking their calls.
In a first in many months, gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw an inflow of over Rs 1,000 crore, which was attributed by Venkatesh to investors taking advantage of a dip in bullion prices lately.
Industry players launched a total of 14 new fund offerings in August, through which they mobilised Rs 7,531 crore, as per the Amfi data.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/mutual-fund-sips-touch-record-high-august-rbis-crr-impacts-debt-aums-amfi-8934911/,business

Customer data with account aggregators completely safe in India: Sitharaman,"Account aggregators (AA) are entities that enable financial data sharing from Financial Information Providers (FIPs) to Financial Information Users (FIUs), based on the consent from the customers.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday assured that customer data shared with account aggregators (AA) is completely safe in India.
Concerned over the slow movement of the AA scheme, she said, ‚ÄúIt is not as much as I would want to see. It can be better, which means either the building of awareness exercises are not sufficient, adequate‚Äù or there is a need for simplification of technology.
‚ÄúBanks, both public and private, have reviewed it with me once. Banks have become a member or a part of this account aggregators working, and it has actually helped,‚Äù she said at the ‚ÄòDATE with Tech‚Äô event here. She stressed that the enthusiasm of the banks has to be accentuated, only then that it will reach every customer.
Allaying concerns about data security, she said, ‚ÄúInitially, there were some apprehensions that possibly, account aggregators are going to sit over data bank. They cannot hold data. They are just a pass-through. Neither the beneficiary customer nor the bank can sit on it through the AA. They will deal with it only for the purpose of giving credit‚Äù.
ADVERTISEMENT
Asked about what kind of assurance she can provide to customers, Sitharaman said the government‚Äôs approach in creating public platforms for banking facilities ensures customer data protection. ‚ÄúThe moment you agree to be willing to give it, it will be shared without much hindrance. On data protection, I can assure Indian citizens your data remains completely safe,‚Äù she said.
Account aggregators (AA) are entities that enable financial data sharing from Financial Information Providers (FIPs) to Financial Information Users (FIUs), based on the consent from the customers.
On low insurance penetration in India, Sitharaman said there have been experiments by Scheduled Commercial Banks to increase the penetration. Insurance companies will have to be a lot smarter by adopting technology tools and addressing last-mile distribution of their products, she added. ‚ÄúThere is a need for insurance companies to become a lot more tech-ready and through technology, but because insurance is such a sentimental matter. You still need a human interface. Insurance companies will have to adapt technology, bring in more personnel, who can go to the field and only then can we achieve greater and wider insurance coverage,‚Äù she said.
Insurance penetration in India during 2021-22 at 4.2 per cent remained the same as in 2020-21.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/customer-data-with-account-aggregators-completely-safe-in-india-sitharaman-9039665/,business

"World Bank‚Äôs Banga faces pressure on resources, shareholder schisms","Ajay Banga, just 130 days into the job, has a mandate to broaden the multilateral development lender's mission to tackle global crises including climate change, pandemics and fragile states.","World Bank President Ajay Banga will come under pressure this week to focus on climate change, but the former Mastercard CEO first needs to get shareholders in line on how to grow the bank.
Banga, just 130 days into the job, has a mandate to broaden the multilateral development lender‚Äôs mission to tackle global crises including climate change, pandemics and fragile states.
But with annual climate transition finance needs estimated at up to $3 trillion for emerging market and low-income economies by 2030, development advocates are calling on him to make tackling global warming the priority at his first World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings.
ADVERTISEMENT
A G20-commissioned panel of experts recommended in July that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) increase annual lending by $260 billion, more than three times their current pace, to help meet climate needs.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to shareholders see come out with a strong endorsement of that target and a plan to push that forward,‚Äù said Amy Dodd, development policy director at ONE Campaign.
Banga, however, has said the major step from the meetings in Morocco will be the long-awaited shareholder endorsement of modifying the bank‚Äôs anti-poverty mission statement.
The move to add ‚Äúon a livable planet‚Äù has been in process for a year, and the development community is eager for next steps to maintain momentum and scale up financing quickly.
ADVERTISEMENT
The World Bank in April lowered its equity-to-loan ratio to boost lending by $50 billion over 10 years. But many further steps are more complicated and need countries to decide how much taxpayer funds they are willing to contribute or put at risk.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm very skeptical that there‚Äôs going to be a big step forward on the size of the institution in Marrakech,‚Äù said Clemence Landers, a former U.S. Treasury official now with the Center for Global Development in Washington.
This group on Monday published a new scorecard for MDB reforms, saying that broad changes are ‚Äúfirmly in play‚Äù but progress in implementing them has been limited.
COMPLEX MOVES
ADVERTISEMENT
For now, the U.S. wants countries to back loan guarantees by the World Bank, with President Joe Biden pushing a request that Congress approve $2.1 billion in new funding that could unlock $25 billion in new concessional loans over a decade.
A World Bank report to be considered in Marrakech estimates that $10 billion in guarantee commitments could boost lending by $60 billion over that period.
But no other major shareholders have joined the U.S. move, which is viewed as a more palatable alternative for U.S. lawmakers to a general capital increase as this would likely lead to a bigger Chinese shareholding at the bank.
British officials have expressed support for a capital increase, but Germany has favored more issuance of hybrid capital, a debt-like instrument, that the World Bank estimates could add another $40 billion in new lending over a decade.
A bigger move would boost lending against the World Bank‚Äôs ‚Äúcallable capital,‚Äù a cushion of emergency funds pledged by shareholders but not paid-in, but this would require some countries to change laws.
ADVERTISEMENT
Banga has said the move is complex and will take time to negotiate. But the payoff could be huge, with the Rockefeller Foundation estimating a lending increase of some $900 billion over a decade if ratings agencies modified their evaluations.
A U.S. Treasury official told Reuters that the department is working to develop rules for callable capital so that decisions could be made by April 2024.
PLUMBING
ADVERTISEMENT
Banga has played down the lending increases and emphasized his efforts to make the 16,000-strong organization more nimble and focused on projects with measurable impacts, saying he wants ‚Äúto fix the plumbing‚Äù.
Other World Bank presidents, including Jim Yong Kim, were unable to meaningfully reform the bank, which Banga has called ‚Äúdysfunctional‚Äù, despite a talented and dedicated staff.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúHe is shaking things up,‚Äù said a senior official at the U.S. Treasury, which nominated him for the job.
While the Indian born American citizen‚Äôs approach has caused some internal friction, according to bank staff, Banga, 63, has received high marks for pushing the envelope.
‚ÄúBanga had a good start,‚Äù said Michael Krake, who represents Germany on the World Bank‚Äôs executive board.
‚ÄúLet Banga be Banga. Good leaders take thoughtful risks and also make some mistakes,‚Äù Krake added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/world-bank-ajay-banga-faces-pressure-resources-shareholder-schisms-8974719/,business

ZEE Entertainment case: SAT rejects plea filed by Chandra and Goenka against SEBI order,"An expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court had in May had said that the difficulties experienced by Sebi in identifying holders of economic interest were at least partly because of the repeal, in 2019, of the 2014 provisions on ‚Äúopaque structures‚Äù.","The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said that despite tightening norms to lift the veil around the ‚Äòopaque structure‚Äô of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), the regulator has faced a wall since entities actually controlling FPIs are in jurisdictions which leave ambiguity around entities that have economic interest in FPIs, but no ostensible control.
An expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court had in May had said that the difficulties experienced by Sebi in identifying holders of economic interest were at least partly because of the repeal, in 2019, of the 2014 provisions on ‚Äúopaque structures‚Äù. The expert committee was set up to investigate if there was violation of the minimum public shareholding norms and if there was a failure to disclose transactions with related parties with respect to the allegations raised by the Hindenburg Report.
In its affidavit submitted in the Supreme Court Monday, Sebi said that with the regulatory changes governing FPIs in 2018 and 2019, it had tightened the disclosure requirement for beneficial owners (BOs) of FPIs. Further, according to the regulator, in some cases entities having economic interest in an FPI are in jurisdictions where the equivalent PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002) regulations require BO identification only on the basis of control or ownership.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThus, the investment manager/ trustee etc. acting through arrangements such as voting shares/ management shares, is then identified as the BO of the FPI. Consequently, while in compliance with the regulations, the actual investing constituents with economic interest may not be identified as BOs of the FPI. This issue is further accentuated if holdings of such investors are spread through multiple FPIs. FATF (Financial Action Task Force) has also identified the same as a global challenge,‚Äù Sebi said.
Sebi said every FPI had to mandatorily disclose all their BOs upfront, and in the absence of any natural person BO, identify an SMO (Senior Managing Official) as the BO, Sebi said. With this, the dispensation under FPI 2014 regulations that allowed certain FPIs to register, inter-alia, on the basis of an undertaking to provide BO details when sought, was no longer available. In essence, the ability of Sebi to seek additional details as required to ensure compliance with extant regulations existed both during the 2014 regime, and continue to exist currently under the 2019 regulations. There has been no relaxation of any kind on this front either, Sebi said.
The expert committee had said market regulator Sebi ‚Äúsuspects wrongdoing‚Äù on the ownership of FPIs but it was unable to pinpoint the violations. However, in a dig at the regulator‚Äôs policy, the committee said, ‚Äúit appears that the legislative policy stance of Sebi on the ownership structure of FPIs has moved in one direction while the enforcement by Sebi is moving in the opposite direction.‚Äù
Sebi has been investigating the matter since October 23, 2020 whereas the Hindenburg Report was published on January 24, 2023. It is, however, for the Sebi to conclude the investigations in accordance with law within a precise time frame, the committee said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Considering the challenges and to address issues related to minimum public shareholding, Takeover Regulations and Press Note-3 (PN3), Sebi Board in meeting dated June 28, 2023 has approved the proposal for additional granular disclosures to the last investor from specified types of FPIs that either hold more than 50 per cent of their AUM in a single corporate group, or have a total AUM of over Rs 25,000 crore subject to certain exemptions.
The regulator also differed from the views of the expert committee on dealing with allegations of related party transactions (RPTs) ‚Äì arrangements or deals between two entities which have a common interest or a relationship ‚Äì by companies. The Hindenburg Report had questioned the appropriateness of over 6,000 RPTs in the Adani Group, and also pointed to 10 RPTs that were not disclosed, but ought to have been.
Sebi said if a scheme to circumvent regulations is identified, the presence of a long-standing relationship in it can lend credence to the allegation of violation. The expert committee had raised a question regarding burdening an arm‚Äôs length business relationship as being an RPT for no reason other than having been a long-standing relationship.
ADVERTISEMENT
The market regulator also said that if a company circumvents the provisions of a law, it does not take enforcement actions based on amendments that are undertaken subsequently; rather it applies the extant law on circumvention. The expert committee had said that Sebi cannot assail past transactions as being in violation of law stated as not being in force when the transactions were made. ‚ÄúInvoking the spirit of the law would not suffice to pursue a credible means of investigation into the matter, keeping a cloud over the transactions,‚Äù it had said in its report submitted to the Supreme Court in May.

Sebi also differed from the expert committee‚Äôs observations relating to timelines for investigations and proceedings. ‚ÄúPrescribing timelines for initiation of investigation and proceedings may not be appropriate as the Board is mandated to prima facie opinion to appoint an Investigating Authority‚Ä¶ this is dependent on many factors including when the alleged violation was observed/ came to the knowledge of SEBI, analysis of the information and material available on record etc.‚Äù
Noting that the nature, scope and complexity of cases in the securities market vary significantly, and ‚Äúreasonable time‚Äù to complete investigation would depend on the facts of each specific case and availability of information, the regulator argued that prescribing timelines may compromise the quality of investigation. ‚ÄúAdditionally, completion of investigation also depends on various factors including the information provided by the persons being investigated, whether such persons are cooperative or not, availability of information from cross border financial institutions, etc. This may create constraints for the Board to function efficiently and also increase litigation,‚Äù SEBI said.
The expert committee had recommended stipulation of specific timelines for initiation and completion of investigations, initiation of proceedings, and disposal of settlement and proceedings. ‚ÄúSome elements of the timeline may be directory and other elements may be mandatory,‚Äù it had said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-says-tightened-fpi-regulations-but-tax-havens-pose-a-global-challenge-8825112/,business
"Warner vows to keep playing till 2024, hopes he can still make Ashes cut",Warner arrived here on Thursday after being ruled out of the remaining two Tests of the four-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India due to a fractured elbow.,"Struggling Australia opener David Warner on Thursday vowed to keep playing white-ball cricket till 2024 if the selectors decided to end his illustrious Test career.
Warner arrived here on Thursday after being ruled out of the remaining two Tests of the four-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India due to a fractured elbow.
Warner struggled in the opening two Tests against India, managing just 1, 10 and 15 in three innings, while he didn‚Äôt bat in the second innings of the Delhi Test after being subbed out due to concussion.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said I‚Äôm playing to 2024; if the selectors feel that I‚Äôm not worthy of my spot (in Tests), then so be it, and I can push on to the white-ball stuff,‚Äù Warner told reporters at Sydney Airport here.
The 36-year-old veteran left-hander, however, still has hopes of making the cut for this year‚Äôs Ashes tour despite dismal form.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the next 12 months, a lot of cricket‚Äôs ahead for the team and if I can keep scoring runs and putting my best foot forward for the team and I can help my spot, it‚Äôd be great for the team,‚Äù Warner said.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy pickings (for critics) when you‚Äôre 36 going on 37. I‚Äôve seen it before with the ex-players as well.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúSo for me if I‚Äôm taking pressure off the rest of the other guys, and no one‚Äôs worrying about the rest of the team, I‚Äôm happy to do that,‚Äù he added.
Warner‚Äôs Test career came under the cloud following his prolonged lean patch in the format. He had scored just one Test century in the last three years.
On Wednesday, Australia selector Tony Dodemaide refused to comment on Warner‚Äôs Test future and whether he would be considered for Ashes selection.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll address the Ashes planning (at a later time), but we are committed to picking the best fit and available players for Test series, particularly something as big as the Ashes,‚Äù he had said.

"Moody‚Äôs cuts China credit outlook to negative, cites lower growth, property risks","The downgrade reflects growing evidence that authorities will have to provide financial support for debt-laden local governments and state firms, posing broad risks to China's fiscal, economic and institutional strength, Moody's said in a statement.","Ratings agency Moody‚Äôs on Tuesday cut its outlook on China‚Äôs government credit ratings to negative from stable, citing lower medium-term economic growth and risks from a major correction in the country‚Äôs vast property sector.
The downgrade reflects growing evidence that authorities will have to provide financial support for debt-laden local governments and state firms, posing broad risks to China‚Äôs fiscal, economic and institutional strength, Moody‚Äôs said in a statement.
‚ÄúThe outlook change also reflects the increased risks related to structurally and persistently lower medium-term economic growth and the ongoing downsizing of the property sector,‚Äù Moody‚Äôs said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The move by Moody‚Äôs was its first change on its China view since it cut its rating by one notch to A1 in 2017, also citing expectations of slowing growth and rising debt.
While Moody‚Äôs affirmed China‚Äôs A1 long-term local and foreign-currency issuer ratings on Tuesday, it said it expects the country‚Äôs annual GDP growth to slow to 4.0% in 2024 and 2025, and to average 3.8% from 2026 to 2030.
Most analysts believe the economy is on track to hit the government‚Äôs annual growth target of around 5% this year, but activity is highly uneven.
The world‚Äôs second-biggest economy has struggled to mount a strong post-COVID recovery as a deepening crisis in the housing market, local government debt risks, slow global growth and geopolitical tensions have dented momentum. A flurry of policy support measures have proven only modestly beneficial, raising pressure on authorities to roll out more stimulus.

Local government debt reached 92 trillion yuan ($12.6 trillion), or 76% of China‚Äôs economic output in 2022, up from 62.2% in 2019, according to the latest data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
After years of over-investment in infrastructure, plummeting returns from land sales, and soaring costs to battle COVID-19, economists say debt-laden municipalities now represent a major risk to the economy.
China‚Äôs Finance Ministry said it was disappointed by Moody‚Äôs downgrade, adding that the economy will maintain its rebound an positive trend. It also said property and local government risks are controllable.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúMoody‚Äôs concerns about China‚Äôs economic growth prospects, fiscal sustainability and other aspects are unnecessary,‚Äù the ministry said.
In October, China unveiled a plan to issue 1 trillion yuan ($139.84 billion) in sovereign bonds by the end of the year to help kick-start activity, raising the 2023 budget deficit target to 3.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) from the original 3%.

Currently, there are 435 EVs for every public charging station nationwide, according to power ministry data, in contrast to the United States, which has 26 EVs per charger, data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation shows.

For now, property developers including Sobha, and property management firm Prestige, are using this shortage to their advantage, betting that EV chargers in residential properties will make clients pay a premium for units like swimming pools used to in the past.
‚ÄúPeople considering purchasing EVs want assurance that they will have access to charging facilities within the residential complex,‚Äù said Javed Shafiq Rao, senior vice president and head of property management at Prestige, which is investing more in properties with EV chargers.
Sobha has gone a step further and launched two residential projects in Bengaluru with EV charging facilities in all available parking slots.

Other developers betting on the trend include Mahindra Lifespace, Kolte-Patil, Brigade and DLF.
To be sure, Indian authorities are encouraging installation of charging infrastructure, and each state has its own guidelines: Delhi, for example, requires 20% of parking spots to be reserved for EVs, while Uttar Pradesh, which has the most EV registrations, mandates all new housing complexes above 5,000 square metres to have at least one EV charging unit.
‚ÄúNo matter how fast public charging is, you need to go there, stop there to get the charging done, while in home-charging, you plug it in and your EV is fully charged overnight,‚Äù said Ravneet Phokela, Chief Business Officer of energy firm Ather Energy.
India is expected to see sales of more than 10 million EVs a year by 2030, rising more than ten folds from last fiscal year, according to the recent annual Economic Survey.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/india-developers-seek-to-cash-in-on-soaring-ev-sales-with-residential-chargers-9016708/,technology

In a recent chat, Sriram said that he was thrilled about this casting but before he brought Sethupathi on board, there was another actor who had shown his interest in the part and that actor was Saif Ali Khan. However, Sriram had to refuse Saif because he ‚Äúwanted something fresh‚Äù.
Talking to Pinkvilla, Sriram said that he ‚Äúwanted a very unique kind of pairing because that‚Äôs the story requirement.‚Äù ‚ÄúOne should not get any baggage from either of them that what are these people about and so on,‚Äù he shared. After the director cast Katrina in the lead role, he met Saif for the role of the male lead but later decided that he wouldn‚Äôt be right for the part. ‚ÄúI had met another actor who had liked the role also.

"Export-oriented green hydrogen projects may get fiscal support, multi-locational SEZs on the table","The commerce ministry is also looking at notifying SEZs that can be spread out across multiple locations, specifically for green hydrogen projects.","The government is looking at a demand to amend a rule that prevents renewable energy plants set up for captive consumption in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) from receiving tax breaks. The tweak, which is before the Ministry of Commerce, could potentially allow export-oriented green hydrogen projects to avail fiscal benefits for setting up and operating renewable energy plants used for the production of green hydrogen. The commerce ministry is also looking at notifying SEZs that can be spread out across multiple locations, specifically for green hydrogen projects. These suggestions were made by green hydrogen developers at a meeting on October 19 with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), where officials from the Ministry of Commerce were also present, according to the meeting minutes accessed by The Indian Express through the RTI.
Allowing multi-locational SEZs will enable developers to use wind energy for which turbines are placed at a considerable distance from each other. Currently, SEZs must have a contiguous land area of 50 hectares or more, a requirement the commerce ministry is open to relaxing for green hydrogen projects. As per industry estimates, the distance between two wind turbines could be anywhere between 250 metres to 400 metres apart, depending on their size. Without multi-locational SEZs, export-oriented green hydrogen projects using wind energy could face difficulties in securing vast amounts of land for renewable energy generation alone. With multi-locational SEZs, however, they will be able to designate specific and discontiguous patches of land upon which wind turbines are installed as part of a singular SEZ.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/export-oriented-green-hydrogen-projects-may-get-fiscal-support-multi-locational-sezs-on-the-table-9067384/,business
Apple will give Vision Pro buyers a 25-minute tutorial in stores,Vision Pro demo at retail stores to include customising the hardware for individual users.,"Apple retail stores are the best places to experience various Apple devices, and the company will now be using the same space to offer an extensive Vision Pro experience, suggests a report from Bloomberg. According to Mark Gurman‚Äôs latest Power On Newsletter, each Vision Pro demo session will include hardware personalisation and will last up to 25 minutes.
As per the report, Apple employees will first customise the headset by choosing the right light seal by scanning the face, a process, that is said to be similar to registering Face ID on your iPhone. Next, the company will use a special apparatus and fit the headset with the right prescription glasses, where, an Apple employee will manually fit the right lenses to the Vision Pro.
This Apple Store has put a new cabinet on its showroom floor related to the Vision Pro quite a bit early. This is for storing items related to the demos. https://t.co/MPsLc1TIca pic.twitter.com/M6DIdeSgE3
‚Äî Mark Gurman (@markgurman) January 15, 2024
Post the initial prep, Apple will guide customers on how to handle the headset, including how to hold it properly. The demo session is expected to focus on the ability to watch 3D content (Spatial photos and videos), which can be shot on the iPhone 15 Pro series. The session will also include a demo of how Vision Pro can be used as a Mac or an iPad replacement.

Apple is also expected to have designed a second pair of straps, which is more comfortable than the first one and partners like Belkin are also said to launch accessories like battery clip, which lives outside the headset. While this is said to be the experience that one will receive when buying the headset at retail stores, users can also purchase the device directly from the online store, which will not involve any of this. In that case, users might have to scan their face using an iPhone (Face ID) to get the right light seal and one has to even enter the glass prescription (if any) manually.
According to a recent report by Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has readied over 80,000 units of the Vision Pro at launch, which will be available across the US. Consequently, the company is also said to be working on a more affordable variant of the Vision Pro and will slowly transition to an AR glass that might look like a regular sunglass, similar to the recently announced XReal Air 2 Ultra AR at CES 2024.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-vision-pro-25-minutes-demo-9109687/,technology

Leave alone the 2001 and 2004 touring Australian teams which had more than a handful of match-winners, even in 2008 and 2010, they were hard to dislodge. In those tours, they arrived here with a pace unit that is inferior to the current one, but Ricky Ponting ensured India had to earn each run they scored and each wicket they picked up.

Green damaged his right index finger during the Boxing Day test win over South Africa in Melbourne and was only given clearance to return to training by his doctor on Monday following surgery.

"Germany, France and Italy reach agreement on future AI regulation",The three governments are in favour of binding voluntary commitments for both large and small AI providers in the European Union.,"An agreement on how artificial intelligence should be regulated in the future has been reached by Germany, France and Italy, according to a joint paper seen by Reuters, which is expected to accelerate negotiations at the European level.
The three governments are in favour of binding voluntary commitments for both large and small AI providers in the European Union.
The European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council are currently negotiating how the bloc should position itself in this new field.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Parliament presented an ‚ÄúAI Act‚Äù in June, with the aim of averting safety risks from AI applications and avoiding discriminatory effects, but without slowing down the innovative power of this new technology in Europe.

During the discussions, the European Parliament proposed that the code of conduct should initially only be binding for major AI providers, which are primarily from the U.S.
However, the three EU governments have warned against this apparent competitive advantage for smaller European providers. This could lead to less trust in the security of these smaller providers and therefore fewer customers, they said.
The rules of conduct and transparency should therefore be binding for everyone, they added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Initially, no sanctions should be imposed, according to the paper.
However, if violations of the code of conduct are identified after a certain period of time, a system of sanctions could be set up. In the future, a European authority would monitor compliance with the standards, the paper said.

RIL fixes July 20 as record date for share allotment in demerger process,Adani Enterprises last month announced that it has signed a pact to acquire 100 per cent of SEPL.,"Adani Enterprises, the flagship firm of billionaire Gautam Adani‚Äôs group, has bought a close to 30 per cent stake in Start Enterprises Pvt Ltd, which owns the online train ticket booking platform Trainman.
Adani Enterprises last month announced that it has signed a pact to acquire 100 per cent of SEPL.
In a stock exchange filing on Saturday, Adani Enterprises said Adani Digital Labs Pvt Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, has bought a 29.81 per cent stake in SEPL for Rs 3.56 crore.
SEPL had a turnover of Rs 4.51 crore in 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023) fiscal year.
ADVERTISEMENT
While last month, Adani Enterprises had described SEPL as ‚Äúan online train booking and information platform,‚Äù on Saturday it described the firm as one into ‚Äúe-commerce and website development.‚Äù The announcement last month had led to a mini-controversy with Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh seeking to suggest that Adani‚Äôs takeover of Trainman may eventually result in the takeover of IRCTC ‚Äì the Indian Railways‚Äô ticketing and other services arm.
IRCTC had issued a statement to deny the allegation. Explaining the e-ticketing business segment, IRCTC had said that around 14.5 lakh reserved tickets are booked on a daily basis in Indian Railways. Out of these almost 81 per cent are e-tickets and booked through IRCTC itself. Hence, there is no competition between IRCTC and its agents, including Trainman.
Trainman, being a B2C partner of IRCTC contributes 0.13 per cent of total reserved ticketing, it had said adding since these firms are integrated with IRCTC, overall, they help the customers in a smooth ticketing process.
Founded in 2011 by Vineet Chirania and Karan Kumar, Trainman is an Indian travel booking app that enables passengers to check the PNR (Passenger Name Record) status, predicts the possibility of getting a confirmed seat in case of a wait-list, and also provides real-time updates on seat availability, running status, time table, coach position, fare calculator, etc.

How Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs reassurance gave ‚Äòruined‚Äô Shahenshah director some hope while star recovered from life-threatening injury,"Tinnu Anand, who directed Amitabh Bachchan in Shahenshah, recalled the financial strife he experienced during the superstar's recovery from a life-threatening injury.","Actor-director Tinnu Anand recalled the financial fix he found himself in after Amitabh Bachchan was gravely injured on the set of Coolie, leading to a delay in the film Shahenshah, which Tinnu was directing. In an interview, he said that creditors were knocking on his door, and that after a tense few months, Amitabh assured him that he would complete the film.
In an interview with News-18, Tinnu said that he imagined Shahenshah as an Indian version of Superman, with Amitabh alternating between a cowardly cop and a vigilante named Shahenshah, like Clark Kent. Recalling the film‚Äôs troubled production, Tinnu said, ‚ÄúAmitabh fell ill, and he announced that he won‚Äôt be working in films again. He went to hospital, Breach Candy, indefinitely. He was in very, very bad shape after that accident. And the announcement came on Monday or Sunday, that Amitabh Bachchan will not work in films anymore. And I had spent a lot of money for an outdoor schedule. I had creditors coming to my house now.‚Äù

"Por Thozhil to Jigarthanda DoubleX: The best Tamil films of 2023, in the year of Leo and Jailer","While there were commercial juggernauts like Jailer and Leo, Tamil cinema offered a lot more quality films this year like Maaveeran, Jigarthanda DoubleX, and Good Night.","Unlike last year, the box office hits didn‚Äôt end up becoming the critics‚Äô favourites this time around. Vijay‚Äôs Varisu and Leo, and Rajinikanth‚Äôs Jailer might have broken records when it came to collections, but these films are unlikely to make it to ‚Äòbest of‚Äô lists this year. Though they were good entertainers, Tamil cinema did offer more than just two-and-a-half hours of escapism. While quality films were sporadic, there were gems like the long-delayed Koozhangal and the devastating Chittha. In no particular order, here‚Äôs a list of Tamil films that impressed in 2023.
ALSO READ | Most Searched Movies 2023: Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs Jawan tops the list, Shahid Kapoor‚Äôs Farzi top trend on OTT
Por Thozhil
ADVERTISEMENT
This will be a part of almost all the top ten lists of 2023, as the film effortlessly won the hearts of Tamil audiences and critics. The buddy cop-thriller explored all the tropes of the sub-genre and still managed to stay fresh. The film, which follows a novice police officer (Ashok Slevan) and a veteran (Sarathkumar) who are on the trail of a serial killer in Trichy, features gripping moments and effective twists. Director Vignesh Raja manages to deliver the message subtly and without compromising the craft. 
Jigarthanda DoubleX
Karthik Subbaraj‚Äôs return to the silver screen with Jigarthanda DoubleX has restored his position as one of the most promising filmmakers of Tamil cinema. Inspired by Spaghetti Westerns, Kartik has formed a genre of his own, which he calls ‚ÄòPandya Western‚Äô. Despite several twists in the film, it remains captivating thanks to the excellent execution and superlative performances by SJ Suryah and Raghava Lawrence. 
Viduthalai Part 1
ADVERTISEMENT
Vetrimaaran‚Äôs Viduthalai Part 1 is a gut-wrenching tale about a remote tribal village that suffers as a police camp is set up to hunt an alleged terrorist Vaathiyar (Vijay Sethupathi). The story unravels from the perspective of a newly-appointed constable, who is not able to choose what‚Äôs right in the grand scheme of things. An anti-establishment film ‚Äî a rare breed in the current political scenario in India ‚Äî Viduthalai is about the oppressed and the oppressor. Never an easy watch, it makes for essential viewing.
Good Night
2022 had Thiruchitrambalam proving that a blockbuster doesn‚Äôt always need to have an action hero, huge budget and over-the-top action sequences. Good Night, directed by Vinayak Chandrasekaran, might not be as successful as Dhanush‚Äôs romantic drama, but it managed to become a brilliant box-office success story. The story of a protagonist suffering from a snoring issue that puts his marriage in jeopardy was as intriguing as it was enjoyable. With brilliant performances from Manikandan and Meetha Raghunath, director Vinayak Chandrasekaran proved that there‚Äôs more to Tamil cinema than just ‚Äòsuperstars‚Äô. 
Dada
ADVERTISEMENT
Like Good Night, Dada is another small film that emerged as a winner this year. A moving tale about a single alcoholic father taking care of his son and redeeming himself was well-executed by director Ganesh K Babu. With superlative performances by Kavin and Aparna Das, the film can be accused of being bit contrived, but it manages to win you over with its emotional quotient.
Maamannan
Maamannan might not be the best film of Mari Selvaraj, but the Vadivelu and Udhaynidhi Stalin starrer deserves a place on the list. A tale of the titular hero, an MLA from an underprivileged caste, is perhaps the first film to explore the caste politics that exists inside an anti-caste party. Fahad Faasil, Udhaynidhi and Vadivelu together made this film work despite the screenplay taking an easy way out towards the end. Vadivelu as a Dalit politician stands out in an optimistic tale where good once again wins over evil against all odds.
Maaveeran
ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps the most ambitious film of the year in terms of idea, Maaveeran gave Tamil cinema its original superhero. A voice in the head of a coward cartoonist Sathya (Sivakarthikeyan) makes him into a superhero. The voice foretells things, which makes Sathya an invincible fighter as he can guess the next move of his enemies. Maaveeran is fun and thought-proving at the same time, like director Madonne Ashwin‚Äôs last film Mandela.
Chittha
Easily the most haunting and difficult movie to watch this year, director SU Arun Kumar‚Äôs Chittha is about victims of pedophilia and the recourse one should take. It removes our focus from punishing the monsters and directs it towards the wounded. Siddharth has given it all to this devastating story, and it is by far the most sensitive mainstream movie about the least-explored subject. The film follows the story of an uncle and his niece. When the latter goes missing, the uncle wages war against the world to bring her back. The film has the incredible pace of a gripping thriller and the heart of a brilliant emotional drama.     
Ponniyin Selvan 2
ADVERTISEMENT
Mani Ratnam deviated majorly from the source material in the second part of his magnum opus, which worked in favour of the film. While the conclusion to the epic story had a lot of shortcomings such as the fragmented screenplay and the information overload, one has to cut some slack for the director‚Äôs vision and refusal to churn out one ‚Äòmass moment‚Äô after the other. PS 1 and PS 2 might not be perfect films, but they lay a strong foundation for future literary adaptations in Tamil.
Koozhangal
Though the film finished its festival run and became the first Tamil film to win the top prize at the Rotterdam Film Festival, it was released to the public only this year. Directed by PS Vinothraj, Koozhangal is an indie film about the long walk of an angry man in search of his wife, as he is accompanied by his tormented son. The film would open a lot of doors to anyone who hasn‚Äôt had a taste of world cinema. Koozhangal would go down in history as not just the best film of 2023 but of Tamil cinema of all time.

"Hindalco posts 40% slump in Q1 profit on weaker volumes, metal prices","Hindalco's aluminium upstream and downstream businesses experienced 7% and 11% declines in revenue, respectively, while its copper segment reported a 9% growth.","Hindalco Industries, one of the country‚Äôs largest aluminium and copper producers, reported a 40% fall in first-quarter profit on Tuesday as softer volumes and weak metal prices weighed.
The company‚Äôs consolidated net profit fell to 24.54 billion rupees ($296.4 million) in the quarter ended June 30 from 41.19 billion rupees a year earlier.
With consumers largely cutting discretionary spending amid elevated global inflation, canned beverage shipments were curbed leading to soft aluminium sales during April-June.

Net sales in Hindalco‚Äôs U.S. unit Novelis, which accounts for over 63% of the company‚Äôs total revenue, fell about 20% to $4.1 billion in the quarter, it said last week.
Novelis, the world‚Äôs largest producer of rolled aluminium, reported a 25% year-on-year fall in core profit. The company said the drop was ‚Äúprimarily driven by lower shipments, cost inflation, and less favorable metal benefit from recycling.‚Äù
Additionally, a drop in prices of metals such as copper and aluminium during the quarter also hurt the profits of non-ferrous metal companies like Vedanta and Vedanta Group-owned Hindustan Zinc.
Hindalco‚Äôs aluminium upstream and downstream businesses experienced 7% and 11% declines in revenue, respectively, while its copper segment reported a 9% growth.

Why do Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma come across as the perfect couple?,"In a country where cricket and cinema are revered as religions, the union of Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma inevitably sparked a firestorm of attention. However, it's their approach towards their relationship that serves as an inspiration for many.","Right after India lost the World Cup final to Australia, I found my heartbroken husband looking for videos of Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli from the tournament. It was an unusual sight considering he has never shown an interest in actors, let alone their personal lives, and second, he judges those of us who do. Yet, he was captivated by this couple, and especially Anushka, who didn‚Äôt just blew flying kisses to her husband when he scored his 50th century but also embraced him tightly when he sought solace after the final defeat. Talk about couple goals!
But why do Virat and Anushka come across as the perfect couple every time the camera captures them? After all, there are other equally famous and revered Bollywood jodis. There can be no single answer to this question. It‚Äôs perhaps how they articulate their relationship in interviews and how fans align their words with actions caught on camera.

Only 1.55 lakh engineers are likely to be hired in the IT/tech sector,"As major IT companies freeze fresher intake, alternate sectors are opening up demand.","Amid global layoff, hiring of freshers is likely to further decline in the current fiscal as major IT companies look to freeze the intake of freshers, as per a report by TeamLease Digital.
In comparison to 2.3 lakh freshers hired in the previous financial year, 1.55 lakh freshers are likely to be hired in the IT/Tech sector this fiscal, report claims.
With approximately 1.5 million engineering graduates actively seeking IT/tech roles, muted market sentiments and intensified skills evaluation mechanisms have created a turbulent landscape, it added.
The report is based on secondary sources, including news reports and company reports, it said.
Meanwhile, as major IT companies freeze fresher intake, alternate sectors are opening up demand.
Other segments, including Global Capability Centers (GCCs) and non-tech sectors like banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), communication, media and technology, retail and consumer business, life sciences and healthcare, have expanded entry-level hiring. This reflects a noteworthy shift in the hiring landscape, as per the report.
‚ÄúThe tech world is evolving rapidly, and we need to keep up. It is not just about companies broadening their hiring horizons, but also about ensuring that the talent pool of our country is ready for it. A united front can be forged through the collaborative efforts of the industry,
academia, and government, leading to relevant programs and curricula being designed. Government initiatives play a pivotal role in supporting skill development and research projects aimed at tackling industry-specific challenges. This is not a one-off effort, but a collective movement to nurture talent at scale and meet the industry‚Äôs changing needs.‚Äù,‚Äù TeamLease Digital Business Head Krishna Vij said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/only-1-55-lakh-engineers-are-likely-to-be-hired-in-the-it-tech-sector-9075690/,education
A Lesson from IIT | Why so many engineering students feel lost even after cracking tough entrance exams,Topping entrance exams requires the mindset of an Olympic Athlete. But success in University education needs the mindset of an Explorer.,"(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
‚Äî Mohan Raghavan
This is the time of the year when scores of students enter the hallowed portals of universities after cracking the toughest exams. Walking in with a sense of pride, the euphoria often dissipates, leading to dejection, disappointment or a feeling of being lost. Students who were stars in their own schools feel their stardom crumble. To some extent, this is understandable and inevitable as the bar is set several notches higher with so many bright minds around.
Some revel in this new setting and do well. Most find a way to stay afloat, sail through, clutching at dreams of ‚Äúgetting placed‚Äù and ending this academic drudgery. A few are unable to adjust and fall into the trap of hopelessness. However, the vast majority of survivors go through the motions, fumbling from course to course, semester to semester, and internship to placement.
This could account for up to eighty per cent of the student population. Many of them go through their entire graduation without an idea why they struggle or feel lost. To understand one of the major reasons why this happens, let us look at two examples ‚Äî an athlete preparing for the Olympics and an explorer in the forest.
Also read | Potential artists, sportspersons take a backseat because of JEE preparation
The athlete has a clear task in front. Reach the finish line in the shortest amount of time possible. The team of coaches and support staff take care of every aspect of the athletes‚Äô preparation, via training, strength endurance, strategy, competitor analysis, schedule, mental toughness, diet, shoes, dress and equipment.
While the athlete‚Äôs success depends on talent, the quality of the training team, hard work, dedication and following the prescribed regimen of the coaches are paramount. However, this is a passive process where the athlete must submit to the system and the system shapes and powers the worthy ones to glory.
Now, consider an explorer in a forest or a mountain. The end goal is not always clear and variable. Some want to scale the mountain peak, others explore the cave, yet others look to spot tigers and elephants. Even if the goal is known, there are no clear set of steps or regimen to achieve the goal. The coaches can teach the explorers skills to survive in a forest or snowy mountains, climb rocks, swim, read maps, navigate and hunt. They prepare the explorer to respond well to a variety of situations, However, in the forest, explorers must use the skills learnt to create their own maps, strategies or maps, handle uncertainties, make contingency plans and navigate by themselves.
ADVERTISEMENT
The life of a student preparing for the entrance exams is like that of the athlete. The coaching centres prepare the student for the photo finish and the student needs to follow the regimen with a lot of hard work and dedication. After clearing the exams, these champion athletes enter universities. They subconsciously believe that this is one more race and look around for the new set of coaches, instruction manual and a regimented environment.
However, universities, industries and life in the real world are more like forests; students and faculty alike are explorers. Every new course gives students a perspective about one part of the dense forest or teaches them an essential skill.
But the students are still hoping to be given a memo on ‚Äúwhat they are supposed to do next‚Äù. That question can never be answered. Now the students turn to seniors, hostel mates and assorted friends for ‚Äúa tip‚Äù; to figure out ‚Äúhow to ace this course ?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhich courses are better for getting a high CGPA?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhich courses are helpful in internship or placement interviews.‚Äù They hope against hope for the old regimen and an imaginary finish line. Most importantly they are in a tearing hurry to reach there.
A more effective way to deal with this sojourn could be to think of every lesson or concept as one piece of a jigsaw puzzle. This piece must be put together with the other pieces that have come and will continue to come through the years. As time goes by, you now have more and more pieces of the jigsaw fall in place and you have your own map of the forest. Now you know how to get to where you like. You now make your own plans, routes, regimens, and explorations and make it back safe too. You now have an instinctive understanding of the subject which once seemed like a forest. Those who continue to look for regimented instruction manuals tend to store every single piece of jigsaw very safely in a cupboard. They have all the pieces, but they only have information and no knowledge. When the first few pieces of the jigsaw are given, naturally, one cannot find any pieces that mate. This is the main reason many people feel lost in the early years. Many give up too fast on matching the pieces and just start accumulating the pieces. The ones who are curious keep wondering how the pieces are connected. Once they find a pair of matching pieces, they know it is possible. They start looking for more connections and are become engaged. They enjoy their study and are also naturally successful.
ADVERTISEMENT
You‚Äôve cleared the toughest exams to reach where you are. Obviously, you are the cream. Overnight you will not turn into dunces. If you feel lost, it only means that you are approaching it wrong. Waiting for the good old days to come back magically can be fatal. Higher education cannot be run like a hundred-meter dash. Seeking help and changing strategy early can make you the resounding success that you were always meant to be!

"Beyond the rare Rs 1 crore package, IITs help students contribute to nation building: IIT Delhi professor writes","‚ÄúMore often than not, parents and students alike have to be reminded that a few IIT graduates getting a salary package over one crore is an exceptional outlier,‚Äù writes Prof Abhyankar.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
‚Äî Abhijit R. Abhyankar
Every June, people like me get a variety of questions from the parents of prospective IIT students. But the most common one is this ‚Äî ‚ÄúSir, what branch should we choose?‚Äù
This is a challenging question to answer ‚Äî but also the simplest one at the same time.
Let me get to the simple answer first. The ever-evolving Undergraduate (UG) and Postgraduate (PG) academic ecosystem at IITs ensures that the academic programmes are always in tune with the changing industry landscape. So, no matter what branch a student chooses, if they are sincere throughout college, they will have a successful launch into the professional world.
But here‚Äôs when the answer becomes complex. Parents and students often look at branches ‚Äì and even IITs ‚Äî as a means of getting high salary packages. The fact is that they can achieve much more beyond the salary package.
I am not saying that prospective students are not passionate about their fields. However, more often than not, parents and students alike have to be reminded that few IIT graduates getting a salary package over one crore are exceptional outliers.

Hence, it is important to think of newer frameworks to introduce someone to the IIT system and its success. And my proposal is this: students joining the institutes can get an opportunity to contribute to nation-building.
ADVERTISEMENT
And this is no emotional argument. I would argue it‚Äôs a smart one, which creates a win-win situation. There is no denying the fact that every student contributes to nation-building, either directly or indirectly, and in different proportions.
However, the IIT ecosystem, in particular, is a great enabler that helps students connect to the frontier areas of immediate and future national interests and priorities. For some domains, national priorities also happen to be global priorities. Of course, the needs and the context of national and global causes change from time to time.
For example, climate change and sustainable energy are primary concerns that are bothering the entire world. A lot of focus resources will be channelled here for research, innovation, technology development, and policy.
Many of you are aware of India‚Äôs commitment to the world about going net-zero by 2070. In this direction, India has set an ambitious target of installing 500 GW of renewable energy resources by 2030.
ADVERTISEMENT
These are big commitments. To make them viable, the reliance on indigenous resources needs to go up. The entire value chain associated with these targets needs to have a dominant Indian stamp on it.
The same goes for the people who are going to drive these missions. The current and future generations of engineers graduating from top-class institutes including the IITs will have a key role to play in achieving these national targets. And with its academic programmes and research setup, IITs can be key to this project.
IITs conduct periodic curriculum review where the old programmes are revamped. New programmes are introduced to keep in tune with the recent and future trends.
For example, one of the programmes proposed by the recently announced IIT Delhi ‚ÄìAbu Dhabi campus is on Energy and Sustainability. This covers the entire spectrum in that space including the technology, analytics and policy aspects.

The research and consultancy projects carried out by faculty members in IITs are inextricably linked to the demands of the industry. Through these projects, the UG and PG students get an insight into real life problems.
Those getting exposure to power engineering, for example, would get a chance to get involved in designing and planning the electric transmission grid for the entire country. Those associated with chemical technology would get an opportunity to develop a disruptive technology for energy storage of the future. Those interested in communication engineering may get involved in development of a strong communication backbone for future smart networks. Add to this the many success stories of start-ups emerging out of these projects.
What can be more satisfying than working in a field of your interest and contributing to national and global causes while also getting handsomely paid for it?

Karan Johar says Zoya Akhtar gave him a lecture on why stalking is wrong: ‚ÄòThen you have someone like Sandeep Reddy Vanga‚Ä¶‚Äô,Karan Johar said that he has now evolved as a filmmaker and understands that stalking isn't love.,"Filmmaker Karan Johar has opened up about his creative process, and personal evolution as a director. Karan admitted to making mistakes in his earlier movies, and explained how his views on intense romance have changed over time. What he once thought was passion, he later learned was no different from stalking. The filmmaker also revealed the advice given by fellow filmmaker Zoya Akhtar. 
In an interview with Film Companion, Karan said, ‚ÄúI never viewed Rocky Aur Rani as a love story; I saw it as my homage to Hindi cinema. What I aimed to do was bring in a commentary on things I strongly believe in. I grew up dancing to Indian music on my own and being mocked by my friends. Moreover, I grew up understanding that people can have love stories that are brushed under the carpet because I‚Äôve known it in my own family.‚Äù

The BSE‚Äôs 30-share Sensex climbed 930 points, or 1.34 per cent, to end at a new high of 70,514.2. It touched 70,602.89 for the first time during the intraday trades.
The NSE‚Äôs Nifty gained 256.35 points, or 1.23 per cent, to close at an all-time high of 21,182.7.

The US Federal Reserve kept the Fed Funds Target Rate (FFTR) unchanged at 5.25-5.5 per cent as inflation eased from its highs.
In a press conference after the announcement of the policy, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said if the economy evolves as projected, the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be 4.6 per cent at the end of 2024, 3.6 per cent at the end of 2025, and 2.9 per cent at the end of 2026, still above the median longer-term rate.
Geojit Financial Services‚Äô Chief Investment Strategist V K Vijayakumar said the clear dovish message from the Fed on December 13 has set the stage for a smart Santa Claus rally in the coming days, and this can even trigger a pre-election rally that can take the markets to a series of new highs.
‚ÄúThe takeaway from the Fed message is that the tightening cycle is over and three rate cuts are possible in 2024. The market expects four. The record breaking rally in the Dow will send many indices to new records,‚Äù he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Fed‚Äôs decision led to a fall in the yield on 10-year US bond to around 4 per cent, while domestic 10-year bond yield fell to one-month low at 7.20 per cent.
Nifty Midcap and Small-cap indices also registered fresh all-time highs. Advancing shares outnumbered declining shares for the second day in the row as advance decline ratio stood at 1.21 levels on BSE.
‚ÄúNext resistance for Nifty is seen at 21,430, which happens to be 76.4 per cent extension level of the recent swings. The psychologically important number of 21,000 now becomes support for Nifty,‚Äù said Devarsh Vakil, Deputy Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

Domestic equity indices have been rallying for the past few days buoyed by strong growth prospects, hopes of political continuity after the 2024 general elections, improvement in corporate earnings and easing crude oil prices.
So far in the current month, the Sensex and the Nifty have gained over 5 per cent.
‚ÄúFavourable macro environment, buying by FIIs, fall in bond yields and crude oil prices is helping the market to scale new highs. Growth stocks will be in focus, with expectations of rate cuts globally in 2024,‚Äù said Siddhartha Khemka, Head ‚Äì Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
Some of the sectors that are likely to benefit from lower interest rates are banking, IT, auto, and real estate.
While foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought Rs 3,570 worth of domestic equities on a net basis, domestic institutional investors purchased Rs 553.17 crore of shares, the BSE‚Äôs provisional data showed.

So far in December, FPIs have invested Rs 39,260 crore, compared to Rs 9,000 crore in November.
Vijayakumar said the crash in the US 10-year yield to around 4 per cent will trigger large capital flows to India. The main beneficiaries will be the large caps, particularly the fairly valued large caps in banking. IT too is likely to attract buying.

China Evergrande files for protection in US court as part of $32 billion debt overhaul,"Embattled developer China Evergrande Group has filed for protection from creditors in a US bankruptcy court as part of its debt restructuring process, as anxiety grows over China's worsening property crisis and a weakening economy.","Embattled developer China Evergrande Group has filed for protection from creditors in a U.S. bankruptcy court as part of its debt restructuring process, as anxiety grows over China‚Äôs worsening property crisis and a weakening economy.
The company sought protection under Chapter 15 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, which shields non-U.S. companies that are undergoing restructurings from creditors that hope to sue them or tie up assets in the United States.
The filing is procedural in nature, but the world‚Äôs most indebted property developer with more than $300 billion in liabilities has to do it as part of a restructuring process under U.S. law, two people familiar with the matter said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The developer‚Äôs offshore debt restructuring involves a total of $31.7 billion, which include bonds, collaterals and repurchase obligations.
Also Read | China‚Äôs government tries to defuse economic fears after real estate developer‚Äôs debt struggle
The sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Evergrande declined to comment.
Once China‚Äôs top-selling developer, Evergrande has become the poster child of the country‚Äôs unprecedented debt crisis in the property sector, which accounts for roughly a quarter of the economy, after slipping into a liquidity crisis in mid-2021.
A string of Chinese property developers have defaulted on their offshore debt obligations since then, leaving unfinished homes, plunging sales and shattering investor confidence in a blow to the world‚Äôs second-largest economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
The property sector crisis has also fanned financial contagion risk, which could have a destabilising impact on an economy already weakened by tepid domestic consumption, faltering factory activity, rising unemployment and weak overseas demand.
A major Chinese asset manager missed repayment obligations on some investment products and warned of a liquidity crisis, while Country Garden, the country‚Äôs largest private developer, has become the latest to flag a stifling liquidity crunch.
All of this comes at a time when property investment, home sales and new construction have contracted for more than a year.
ADVERTISEMENT
Morgan Stanley this week followed some of the major global brokerages to cut China‚Äôs growth forecast for this year. It now sees China‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) growing 4.7% this year, down from an earlier forecast of 5%.
DEBT RESTRUCTURING
Evergrande announced an offshore debt restructuring plan in March, expecting it to facilitate a gradual resumption of operations and generation of cash flow. It is now gathering creditor support to complete the process.
Evergrande‚Äôs creditors will vote later this month on its restructuring proposal, with possible approval by Hong Kong and British Virgin Islands courts in the first week of September.
An affiliate of the developer, Tianji Holdings, also sought Chapter 15 protection on Thursday in Manhattan bankruptcy court.
In a filing in the Manhattan bankruptcy court, Evergrande said that it was seeking recognition of restructuring talks underway in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.
ADVERTISEMENT
The company proposed scheduling a Chapter 15 recognition hearing for Sept. 20.
In June last year, another Chinese developer, Modern Land (China) Co. Ltd, which missed payments on its offshore bonds that were due in Oct, 2021, had filed a petition for recognition under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code in New York.

Australia suffered a crushing defeat by an innings and 132 runs after being all out for just 91 in their second essay in the session between lunch and tea on the third day.
‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt,‚Äù is what the skipper said when asked if he expected the match to end well inside three days.
‚ÄúWe were prepared to have hard day‚Äôs bowling, spending session after session. We never thought they would get bowled out in a session.
‚ÄúAs you saw, the pitch became slower and slower and there was no bounce on the pitch, so it was a bit of surprise for me,‚Äù the Indian skipper said at the post-match press conference.
There was a lot of pre-match talk from the Australian media with one leading newspaper terming the Jamtha track as ‚Äúsystematically doctored‚Äù while other termed it ‚Äúdodgy‚Äù even before a ball was bowled.
The calm Indian skipper in his own inimitable manner rubbed it in when asked if he found his team to be mentally tougher than Australia.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know the mental status of the Australian team. I can vouch for our team and we are the ones who want to play on pitches like these and not just from now, we have been playing on pitches like these for last 3-4 years,‚Äù the skipper said.
He continued with his sarcastic way of saying things.
‚ÄúBecause we have all grown up playing on pitches like these, so there is no talk about pitches anymore in the changing room.‚Äù For the Indian skipper, preparation whether for a cricket match or in any aspect of life is key to success.
‚ÄúI give a lot of credit to training sessions in Civil Lines before we came here. We had four or five net sessions and prepared the kind of pitch we were supposed to get here.
‚ÄúWhether going down the track or sweeping, reverse sweep, hitting over top, when you prepare well, you get confidence and not just in cricket but everywhere,‚Äù he stated.

Japan-led XRISM mission reveals its first X-ray picture of cosmos,"XRISM, the ambitious Japanese-led mission, gave us a sneak peak into what its science operations will reveal over the years.","The Japanese-led XRISM (X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission) on Saturday released a first look at the data that scientists expect it to collect when science operations begin this year.
The mission team revealed an image of hundreds of galaxies and a spectrum of stellar wreckage in a nearby galaxy, which can tell scientists what they are made of.
‚ÄúXRISM will provide the international science community with a new glimpse of the hidden X-ray sky. We‚Äôll not only see X-ray images of these sources but also study their compositions, motions, and physical states,‚Äù said Richard Kelley, the US principal investigator for XRISM at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Flight Center, via a statement.
In case you are wondering, XRISM is pronounced ‚Äúcrism,‚Äù and it is led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in collaboration with NASA and the European Space Agency. The space observatory is designed to detect X-ray radiation with energy up to 12,000 electron volts. To put that into context, the energy of visible light is between two to three electron volts. Therefore, it is designed to study the hottest regions in the universe, along with its largest structures and the objects with the strongest gravity.

XRISM is carrying just two instruments ‚Äî Resolve and Xtend ‚Äî and each of them focuses of the same X-ray Mirror assembly. Resolve is a microcalorimeter spectrometer, and it sits inside a refrigerator-sized container of liquid helium at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. X-rays warm the device by an amount related to its energy. Scientists can use the measure of each individual X-ray‚Äôs energy to glean knowledge about the source.
The mission team used Resolve to study N132D, which is a supernova tenant and one of the brightest sources of X-rays in the Large Magellanic Cloud. That is a dwarf galaxy that is about 160,000 light-years away from us in the constellation Dorado. This expanding wreckage was created when a star around 15 times the Sun‚Äôs mass ran out of fuel, collapsed and exploded over 3,000 years ago.

Xtend, the mission‚Äôs second instrument, is an X-ray imager with a large field of view, able to observe an area about 60 per cent larger than the average apparent size of the full moon. Scientists used Xtend to capture an X-ray image of Abell 2319.

Air India commissions mega warehouse facility in Delhi for storage of engineering spares,"Spread across 54,000 sq ft and located near Terminal 3, at Delhi Airport's cargo complex, Air India's centralised warehousing facility will improve the turnaround time of flights operating out of Delhi, the company said.","Air India on Friday said it has commissioned a mega warehouse facility in Delhi for storing over 1,000,000 engineering spares for aircraft maintenance.
Spread across 54,000 sq ft and located near Terminal 3, at Delhi Airport‚Äôs cargo complex, the centralised warehousing facility will improve the turnaround time of flights operating out of Delhi, the company said.
The facility will offer a one-stop solution for storing aircraft spares, tools and ground support equipment ranging from hardware to sophisticated and complex avionics, hydraulics, structural, pneumatic, and mechanical components, it said.

"Services give fillip to growth, GDP up 7.8% in April-June","Capital formation, a proxy for investments, and private consumption expenditure, an indicator of consumption demand, posted growth rates of 8 per cent and 6 per cent in Q1 FY24, respectively.","INDIA‚ÄôS REAL Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rose to a four-quarter high of 7.8 per cent in April-June, mainly due to a pickup in agriculture and services especially financial, real estate and professional services and contact-intensive services of trade, hotel and transportation, data released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday showed. Manufacturing and construction sectors, however, recorded slower-than-expected growth rates.
Capital formation, a proxy for investments, and private consumption expenditure, an indicator of consumption demand, posted growth rates of 8 per cent and 6 per cent in Q1 FY24, respectively. These had recorded higher growth rates of 20.4 per cent and 19.8 per cent, respectively, in the corresponding period a year ago. As a share of GDP, private consumption expenditure dropped to 57.3 per cent of GDP in April-June from 58.3 per cent in the year-ago period.
Surprisingly, there was a contraction of 0.7 per cent in government expenditure in the first quarter this year ‚Äî its share in GDP also decreased to 10.1 per cent of GDP from 11 per cent; exports also recorded a contraction of 7.7 per cent, while imports increased by 10 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
Economists pointed out that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is skewed more towards organised sector‚Äôs growth, a trend reflective of the ongoing recovery still not being broad-based enough. Going ahead, consumption demand may also get affected amid inflationary pressures and weak external demand, they said.
Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran said India‚Äôs quarterly GDP growth is way higher than the GDP print of many other economies and that the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are comfortable in holding on to their FY24 GDP growth forecast of 6.5 per cent. He said the services sector has been the main driver of growth along with an uptick in capital formation. He said the government‚Äôs capital expenditure push is ‚Äúpaying off‚Äù and is crowding in private investment.
EXPLAINED
The monsoon factor
Going ahead, the government is concerned if it can sustain the growth momentum, given the lower than expected rain which may not just impact incomes, but also keep prices high and affect consumption demand in coming months.
‚ÄúWhen I spoke to you at the end of May, I did say that compared to what we said in January in the Economic Survey, wherein we said that the downside risk factors were higher than the upside surprises to the 6.5 per cent forecast ‚Äì the risks are now evenly balanced around our central expectation of 6.5 per cent. We maintain that view,‚Äù he said.
The RBI had projected a first quarter growth rate of 8 per cent, coming on the back of a 6.1 per cent growth in January-March and a 13.1 per cent growth in April-June 2022. ‚ÄúReal GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 6.5 per cent with Q1 at 8 per cent; Q2 at 6.5 per cent; Q3 at 6.0 per cent; and Q4 at 5.7 per cent,‚Äù RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said earlier this month.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the latest data, five of the eight key sectors registered over 5 per cent growth in April-June, with two sectors recording a higher growth rate than the year-ago period ‚Äî ‚Äòfinancial, real estate and professional services‚Äô at 12.2 per cent as against 8.5 per cent in the year-ago period, and ‚Äòagriculture, forestry and fishing‚Äô at 3.5 per cent as against 2.4 per cent.
Manufacturing grew at 4.7 per cent in April-June 2023 as against 6.1 per cent in April-June 2022, while mining and quarrying grew at 5.8 per cent, lower than 9.5 per cent a year ago. Construction sector grew at 7.9 per cent in April-June this year as against 16 per cent growth in the corresponding period last year.
Economists pointed out that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is skewed more towards organised sector‚Äôs growth. ‚ÄúManufacturing growth at 4.7% should be viewed more from the point of view of lower performance of the unorganised sector as profit growth and hence value addition has been high for the corporate sector which gets included here. The push is provided by the services sector where both trade, transport etc. and finance and real estate have grown by 9.2% and 12.2% in high base growth rates. The relentless uptick in PMIs gets reflected here where pent up demand has kept the mood up. This will tend to taper down in the coming quarters,‚Äù Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist, Bank of Baroda, said.

A broad-based recovery in private consumption is some distance away, India Ratings said. ‚ÄúThe current consumption demand is skewed towards goods and services consumed largely by the households falling in the higher income bracket,‚Äù Sunil Kumar Sinha, Senior Director & Principal Economist, India Ratings said.
Going ahead, erratic monsoon and inflationary pressures could affect consumption demand, economists said. ‚ÄúThe road ahead is not going to be easy so long as PFCE does not recover fully and become broad based. Also, the impact of El Nino on this year‚Äôs monsoon could bring agricultural growth under pressure and the spillover effect of this would be felt on food inflation. A government intervention in agriculture and drought relief measures could pressure and destabilise the fiscal arithmetic of FY24. Amidst these challenges, however, revival of private corporate capex is expected to bring relief to the economy,‚Äù Sinha said.
The GDP print could also have fiscal implications as the government‚Äôs budget metrics are linked to nominal GDP growth, which has come in just 0.2 percentage points higher than the real GDP at 8 per cent. Nominal GDP accounts for the inflation rate and the deflator for GDP is linked to the wholesale price index-based inflation, which has been in the negative territory for the last four months.
DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India, said, ‚ÄúThe proximity of real GDP growth at 7.8% with nominal GDP growth at only 8% has significant fiscal implications. These growth rates imply that the implicit price deflator (IPD) based inflation is only 0.2%. Such a low IPD inflation is seen after 15 quarters. With a low nominal GDP growth, tax revenue growth is expected to be muted. As per the CGA data, the buoyancy of Centre‚Äôs gross tax revenues (GTR) is only 0.4 in the first quarter. If low nominal GDP growth is combined with a significantly low buoyancy, the resultant tax revenue growth is expected to be considerably low.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-q1-gdp-growth-april-june-quarter-8917828/,business
P-notes investment continues to swell for seventh month on robust macros,"This is the highest level since July 2017 -- when investment through the route stood at Rs 1.35 lakh crore, data from the Sebi showed.","Investment in the Indian capital markets through participatory notes rose over a six-year high at Rs 1.33 lakh crore at September-end, making it the seventh consecutive monthly increase, on the back of robust macroeconomic fundamentals.
This is the highest level since July 2017 ‚Äî when investment through the route stood at Rs 1.35 lakh crore, data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed.
The latest data includes the value of p-note investments in Indian equity, debt, and hybrid securities. Participatory notes (P-notes) are issued by registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to overseas investors who wish to be part of the Indian stock market without registering themselves directly.

They, however, need to go through a due diligence process.
According to Sebi data, the value of p-note investments in Indian markets ‚Äî equity, debt, and hybrid securities ‚Äî stood at Rs 1,33,284 crore at the end of September as compared to Rs 1,28,249 crore a month earlier.
In comparison, investment through the route was Rs 1.23 lakh crore in July, Rs 1.13 lakh crore in June, Rs 1.04 lakh crore at May-end, Rs 95,911 crore at April-end, Rs 88,600 crore at March-end, Rs 88,398 crore at February-end and Rs 91,469 crore at January-end.
The growth in p-notes generally aligns with the trend in FPI flows. When there is a global risk to the environment, investment through this route increases, and vice-versa.
ADVERTISEMENT
Market analysts say one of the prime factors for the growth in p-notes investments is the stable Indian economy against an uncertain global macro backdrop.
‚ÄúBesides India‚Äôs robust macros and rising attractiveness as an investment destination, investments through p-notes offer other advantages like anonymity (Sebi registration not required), ease of trading, and tax savings in select cases. In general, p-notes follow broader FPI trend, ‚Äù Kedar Kadam, Director ‚Äì Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors, said.
‚ÄúWith India projected to be the fastest growing economy in the world, strong corporate earnings trajectory and attractive demographics, we believe the flows into Indian equities will continue in the coming years so long as ease of investing continues via p-notes,‚Äù he added.

Of the total Rs 1.33 lakh crore invested through this route till September, Rs 1.22 lakh crore was invested in equities, Rs 10,688 crore in debt, and Rs 389 crore in hybrid securities.
In addition, assets under custody of FPIs grew to Rs 58.45 lakh crore at September-end from Rs 57.63 lakh crore in the preceding month.

"Elon Musk‚Äôs X restructuring curtails disinformation research, spurs legal fears",Musk's restrictions on critical methods of gathering data on the global platform have suppressed the ability to untangle the origin and spread of false information during real-time events such as Hamas' attack on Israel and the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.,"Social media researchers have canceled, suspended or changed more than 100 studies about X, formerly Twitter, as a result of actions taken by Elon Musk that limit access to the social media platform, nearly a dozen interviews and a survey of planned projects show.
Musk‚Äôs restrictions on critical methods of gathering data on the global platform have suppressed the ability to untangle the origin and spread of false information during real-time events such as Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel and the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, researchers told Reuters.
The most important method was a tool that gave researchers access to data about 10 million tweets per month. Twitter notified researchers in February it would end free academic access to this application programming interface (API) as part of an overhaul of the tool, according to an email seen by Reuters.

The survey of 167 academic and civil society researchers conducted at Reuters‚Äô request by the Coalition for Independent Technology Research in September quantifies for the first time the number of studies that have been cancelled due to Musk‚Äôs policies.

It also shows a majority of survey respondents fear being sued by X over their findings or use of data. The worry follows X‚Äôs July lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) after it published critical reports about the platform‚Äôs content moderation.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment and an X representative declined to comment. The company has previously said that nearly all content views are of ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù posts.
Musk‚Äôs first year of ownership of X has been marked by advertisers fleeing the site, concerned that their ads could appear next to harmful content. X‚Äôs U.S. ad revenue declined at least 55% year-over-year each month since Musk‚Äôs acquisition, Reuters previously reported.
ADVERTISEMENT
The survey showed 30 canceled projects, 47 stalled projects and 27 where researchers changed platforms. It also revealed 47 ongoing projects, though some researchers noted that their ability to collect fresh data would be limited.
The affected studies include research on hate speech and topics that have garnered global regulatory scrutiny. In one example, a stalled project sought to study child safety on X. The platform was recently fined by an Australian regulator for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.
The researcher for the stalled project and several others who responded to the Coalition‚Äôs survey requested to remain anonymous. An author of the survey said researchers may seek to avoid backlash from X or protect ongoing studies.
European Union regulators are also currently investigating X‚Äôs handling of disinformation, which was the focus of multiple stalled or canceled independent research studies, the survey found.
ADVERTISEMENT
The reduced ability to study the platform ‚Äúmakes users on (X) vulnerable to more hate speech, more misinformation and more disinformation,‚Äù said Josephine Lukito, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.
She helped conduct the research survey for the coalition, a global group with more than 300 members, that works to advance the study of technology‚Äôs impact on society.
The survey was sent in mid-September by email to the coalition‚Äôs members as well as email lists for other academic groups, such as experts focused on political communication or social media.
The EU‚Äôs investigation of X, under new strict internet rules that took effect in August, underscore the potential regulatory threat to the San Francisco-based company. Any violation could result in fines of up to 6% of global revenue.

An EU Commission spokesperson said it is currently monitoring X‚Äôs, as well as other large platforms‚Äô, compliance with the law‚Äôs obligations, which includes allowing researchers who meet certain conditions to gain access to publicly available data.

UNAFFORDABLE COST
Before Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion, a large proportion of studies about social media had been related to Twitter, because the platform was a valuable source of information about politics and current events. Its data was easily accessible, four researchers told Reuters.
But almost from the moment Musk stepped into Twitter‚Äôs headquarters, he began slashing costs and laying off thousands of employees, including those who worked on the research tools.
Now, X offers three paid tiers of the API ranging from $100 to $42,000 per month, and the lower-priced tiers provide less data than what was available to researchers for free previously. Nearly every researcher who spoke with Reuters said they could not afford the costs.

One former employee, who declined to be named for fear of backlash from Musk, said the decision to shut down free academic API access came down to an urgent need to focus on boosting revenue and cutting costs in the aftermath of Musk‚Äôs takeover.
A majority of survey respondents cited the API changes as the reason for canceling or pausing their studies about the platform.
The unaffordable cost of paying to receive less data than what was available previously means research ahead of 2024, a major election year globally, is severely challenged, Lukito said.
Tim Weninger, a professor of engineering at University of Notre Dame, said his team has been ‚Äúflying blind‚Äù while trying to track China-linked information operations without data from the API, the cost of which is prohibitive, he said.

Several researchers told Reuters they now have limited options to study X, such as manually analyzing posts.
Researchers also face limitations in gathering data from other social platforms. Short-form video app TikTok announced an academic research API earlier this year, but its onerous terms and conditions limit its usefulness for researchers, said Megan A. Brown, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, in a blog post she wrote for Tech Policy Press while a researcher at New York University.
Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta Platforms has partnered with external researchers on studies, which is not a substitute for independent research, but shows Meta‚Äôs willingness to collaborate, Lukito said.
LEGAL CONCERNS
The CCDH, an organization that said it aims to fight hate speech and disinformation, published several reports after Musk‚Äôs acquisition that claimed the social media platform failed to moderate and also profited from harmful content.

X sued CCDH in July, accusing the organization of improperly accessing data from the platform and promoting false claims about X‚Äôs moderation.
‚ÄúMusk wants to silence any criticism of the way he does business,‚Äù said CCDH Chief Executive Imran Ahmed, adding CCDH stood by its reports.
In the survey from the Coalition for Independent Technology Research, 104 out of 167 respondents cited the possibility of legal action due to either their use of data or their research findings as a concern about their projects.
‚ÄúThe move against the CCDH communicates to researchers looking at misinformation and hate speech on online platforms that there is intrinsic liability in publicly disseminating findings,‚Äù said Bond Benton, an associate professor at Montclair State University, which produced a study last year that found hate speech increased on Twitter in the hours after Musk‚Äôs takeover.

One researcher, who declined to be named, was studying how the subject of rape is discussed on X and told the survey they were worried about legal risk and the scientific validity of data collected without access to the API. The researcher said they moved the study to examine a different social media platform.
Musk and X CEO Linda Yaccarino have articulated a new policy called ‚Äúfreedom of speech, not reach‚Äù that restricts the distribution of some posts but refrains from deleting them from the platform.
X has said 99% of content that users see on the platform is ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù which the company attributed in July to estimates from Sprinklr, a software company that helps brands monitor market trends and customer sentiment online.
A spokesperson for Sprinklr, which is listed as an official partner of Twitter, declined to confirm the figures cited in the July post after Reuters requested comment and said ‚Äúany recent external reporting prepared by Twitter/X has been done without Sprinklr‚Äôs involvement.‚Äù
The spokesperson pointed to a March blog post that said toxic posts on X received three-times fewer views than non-toxic posts.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/elon-musks-x-restructuring-curtails-disinformation-research-spurs-legal-fears-9016737/,technology

Women U-19 World Cup: India beat NZ by 8 wickets to enter final,India restricted New Zealand to 107 for nine with Parshavi (3/20) leading a disciplined bowling effort after skipper Shafali Verma won the toss and elected to bowl in the first semifinals.,"Opener Shweta Sherawat smashed an unbeaten fifty after Parshavi Chopra‚Äôs triple strike as India notched up a comprehensive eight-wicket win over New Zealand to storm into the final of the inaugural Under-19 Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup here on Friday.
India restricted New Zealand to 107 for nine with Parshavi (3/20) leading a disciplined bowling effort after skipper Shafali Verma won the toss and elected to bowl in the first semifinals.
The 16-year-old leg-spinner broke the backbone of the Kiwi batting line-up with three successive wickets to leave them at 74 for 5 in 13th over.
Titas Sadhu, Mannat Kashyap, Shafali and Archana Devi also scalped one wicket each.
For NZ, Georgia Plimmer (35), Isabella Gaze (26) and Izzy Sharp (13) and Kayley Knight (12) reached double figures as they struggled to score runs at the Senwes Park.
Chasing 108, the women in blue romped home comfortably after Sehrawat produced a scintillating 45-ball unconquered knock which was studded with 10 hits to the fence.
Following the early exit of Shafali (10), who has not performed as per expectations in the tournament, Sehrawat and Soumya Tiwari (22) added 62 runs to take them to the threshold of victory.

Sehrawat and Gongadi Trisha (5) then completed the job with the former bringing up the winning runs with a four off Browning as India scored 110 for 2 in 14.2 overs.
Parshavi was adjudged the Player of the Match for her three-wicket haul.

China receives US equipment to make advanced chips despite new rules,"The finding comes as the United States scrambles to figure out how Chinese telecoms giant Huawei was able to produce an advanced 7 nanometer chip to power its Mate 60 Pro smartphone at China's top chipmaker SMIC, despite the export curbs announced last year.","Chinese companies are buying up U.S. chipmaking equipment to make advanced semiconductors, despite a raft of new export curbs aimed at thwarting advances in the country‚Äôs semiconductor industry, a report said on Tuesday.
The 741 page annual report, released by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, takes aim at the Biden administration‚Äôs Oct. 2022 export curbs, which seek to bar Chinese chipmakers from getting U.S. chipmaking tools if they would be used to manufacture advanced chips at the 14 nanometer node or below.
With the Commerce Department using the 14 nanometer restriction limit, ‚Äúimporters are often able to purchase the equipment if they claim it is being used on an older production line, and with limited capacity for end-use inspections, it is difficult to verify the equipment is not being used to produce more advanced chips,‚Äù the report stated.

Huawei and SMIC were also added to a trade restriction list in 2019 and 2020, which in theory bars U.S. suppliers from shipping certain technology to the companies.
China watchers had theorized that SMIC could have made the chip with equipment obtained prior to the October 2022 rules, but it had other options for obtaining the equipment from oversees, the report shows.
The United States managed to plug a key loophole in its efforts to stymie China‚Äôs access to advanced chipmaking tools by convincing allies Japan and the Netherlands, with similarly robust chipmaking equipment industries, to announce their own restrictions on exports of the coveted technology.
ADVERTISEMENT
But China stockpiled equipment by taking advantage of the lagtime between the United States‚Äô October 2022 rules, and Japan and the Netherlands‚Äô similar moves in July and September of 2023 respectively, the report details.
According to the document, between January and August 2023, China imported $3.2 billion (RMB 23.5 billion) worth of semiconductor manufacturing machines from the Netherlands, a 96.1% increase over the $1.7 billion (RMB 12 billion) recorded over the same period in 2022. China‚Äôs imports of semiconductor equipment from all countries totaled $13.8 billion (RMB 100 billion) over the first eight months of 2023, it added.
The report does not outline a specific recommendation to address the gaps in the U.S. rules, but urges Congress to request an annual evaluation, to be completed within 6 months by the General Accountability Office and later made public, of the effectiveness of export controls on chipmaking equipment to China.

When asked about his status as a working nonagenarian over the years, Nussbaum said he simply enjoyed the work.

Leg-spinner Parshavi Chopra, opener Shweta Sehrawat, pacer Titas Sadhu, off-break bowler Archana Devi and left-arm spinner Mannat Kashyap were among the standout performers of the U-19 side that outplayed England in the final in Potchefstroom on Sunday.
Mithali, who was invited by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to interact with the cricketers ahead of the inaugural edition, feels women‚Äôs cricket has finally got a platform from where the players can be fast-tracked or groomed for the future.
‚ÄúThe spinners and seamers have been very impressive and in both the departments we need improvement at the senior level. It‚Äôs always good to have more options and build a solid pool of players.
‚ÄúWhen you compare to the highest level, there is obviously bit of difference in terms of standards, technique and temperament at the U-19 level.
‚ÄúWe will have to work on them. And from what I saw in South Africa, they are really good,‚Äù Mithali, who called time on a 23-year-old illustrious international career last year, told PTI.

The leading run-getter in women‚Äôs ODI cricket said the NCA in Bengaluru prepared the team well for the first ever global age-group event.

Going forward, she wants all the squad members of the victorious outfit to toil on the domestic circuit while the three or four who are ready for the higher level can be slowly drafted into the national side.
‚ÄúPlaying domestic cricket is very important for them and should not be neglected. WPL will also get them the required exposure.
‚ÄúThe next ODI World Cup is at home and we have not won a global event yet at the senior level. I am sure the BCCI is prioritising that and will keep these players in the mix,‚Äù said the champion batter.
With the talent pool not as big as men‚Äôs cricket, the probability of the women‚Äôs U-19 players reaching international cricket increases significantly. On an average, one or two from the Men‚Äôs U-19 World Cup go on to play for India but Mithali feels the number should be higher in women‚Äôs cricket.
ADVERTISEMENT
She also fondly recalled her interactions with the Shafali Verma-led squad before the start of the tournament in South Africa.
‚ÄúIt was not much of a technical conversation. It was more about the preparation and they had lots of questions on that. Things like how to prepare because these girls are very young and there is a lot of difference in team training and personal training. I spoke about how to make the transition.

‚ÄúThey are very keen learners and because of the level they are at, they are very energetic as well,‚Äù she said.
Mithali was also all praise for Women‚Äôs U-19 head coach Nooshin Al Khadeer.
‚ÄúShe has worked tirelessly with this bunch of cricketers and deserves all the credit. She has done well in all her assignments whether it is with the Railways in domestic cricket and now at the India U-19 level.‚Äù Asked if Nooshin is ready to coach the senior India team, Mithali replied in the affirmative.
‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù

Titled Antony, the makers of the movie unveiled its trailer on Monday and the promo emphasises that it is going to be an action spectacle with Joju George and Kalyani Priyadarshan at the centre.

Among them, Antony Anthrapper (Joju George) stands out as the most infamous, described by a police officer as having killed a sub-inspector, setting him on fire. The trailer also vividly depicts Antony‚Äôs prowess as he single-handedly overpowers and defeats his rivals.

However, the teaser emphasises that he is not the only person to look out for. Ann Mariya (Kalyani Priyadarshan), despite her affectionate and compassionate nature, refuses to passively endure the challenges thrown at her by life and those around her. One of the characters remarks, ‚ÄúHer interest is more on violence than academics,‚Äù as she is portrayed in a boxing ring, dominating her opponent, and then outside, confronting her rivals. However, it also becomes evident that Antony has a soft spot for Ann.

Antony also marks the reunion of the team behind Joshiy‚Äôs 2019 blockbuster Porinju Mariam Jose. In addition to Joju George and Kalyani Priyadarshan, Antony features Nyla Usha, Chemban Vinod Jose and Vijayaraghavan in significant roles.

Ashwin is a quality bowler but we have tools to counter him: Steve Smith,Australian batters have been focussed on tackling the spin threat and there is a team of Indian net bowlers who is helping the visitors prepare for the four Test series.,"Australia vice-captain Steve Smith may have done a week‚Äôs simulation of Ravichadran Ashwin‚Äôs doppleganger Mahesh Pithiya but he is not overthinking about the star India spinner‚Äôs impact in the Border Gavaskar Trophy beginning here on Thursday.
Australian batters have been focussed on tackling the spin threat and there is a team of Indian net bowlers who is helping the visitors prepare for the four Test series.
Is Australia over-thinking about Ashwin? ‚ÄúThere has been many off-spinners we played and Mahesh is one of them. He bowls a similar style (to that) of Ashwin. We are not overthinking things. Ash is a quality bowler but we have the tools in our kit bag to counter that,‚Äù Smith told reporters during a media conference.
He has had a look at the pitch and good length spot at the far end looks pretty dry.
‚ÄúPretty dry, particularly one end. I think it will take a bit of spin, particularly the left-arm spinner taking it into our left-handers. There‚Äôs a section there that‚Äôs quite dry,‚Äù he added.
But Smith also said that he won‚Äôt be over reading the track.
‚ÄúOther than that, I can‚Äôt really get a good gauge on it. I don‚Äôt think there will be a heap of bounce in the wicket, I think it will be quite skiddy for the seamers and maybe a bit of up-and-down movement as the game goes on.

‚ÄúThe cracks felt quite loose. I‚Äôm not entirely sure ‚Äì we‚Äôll wait and see.‚Äù Smith seemed pretty happy with the preparation.

He shared, ‚ÄúI suggested that there could be a good song here. He said, ‚ÄòNo, it‚Äôs not the right place. The boy and girl have not even met yet.

Animal advance box office collection: Ranbir Kapoor‚Äôs violent revenge saga expected to deliver career-best Rs 50 crore opening,Animal advance box office: Ranbir Kapoor is expected to deliver the biggest opening of his career with Sandeep Reddy Vanga's film.,"Ranbir Kapoor‚Äôs fans were enthralled earlier this week by the first trailer for his upcoming film, Animal. A romantic crime drama directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and co-starring Rashmika Mandanna, the film has been rated ‚ÄòA‚Äô by the Central Board of Film Certification, a tag that the team is wearing like a badge of honour. Vanga courted controversy with his first two films, Arjun Reddy and its Hindi remake Kabir Singh, and seems to be doubling down with Animal, which runs at nearly three-and-a-half hours long.
Vanga refused to compromise on the run time, after delivering a first cut that ran nearly four hours long. Long movies are significantly affected commercially, for the simple reason that distributors can fit fewer shows in a single day. Long movies rated ‚ÄòA‚Äô are further impacted. But Animal will be a true test not only for Vanga, but also for Ranbir who is slowly clawing his way back to the A-list after a mixed run since Sanju. Advance bookings for the film will begin in India on Sunday, November 26.

"India versus Australia Day 2, Nagpur diary: Old-fashioned Jadeja, a Lyon who has forgotten to hunt and Kohli‚Äôs worrying trend","Why did the Nagpur pitch ease out in the morning session? The answer, according to batting legend Sunil Gavaskar, lies in the choice of roller by India captain Rohit Sharma at the start of Day Two","Right roller, light roller
At the end of the first session on Day Two, Mark Waugh and Ravi Shastri were wondering why the pitch appeared to have eased out in the morning. Shastri felt it could be because the moisture had dried up from the pitch. Sunil Gavaskar felt it was the roller. ‚ÄúThe roller makes a big difference. The roller Indians used levelled up the pitch in the first hour. That‚Äôs why we saw a couple of wickets in the second hour, a bit more turn and variable bounce etc‚Äù. It‚Äôs learnt that a light roller was used by the Indians in the morning before the start of play. It‚Äôs the prerogative of the batting captain to choose the roller he wants: heavy or light at the start of the play, according to the ICC‚Äôs playing conditions.

"In a ‚Äòno brainer‚Äô decision, Michael Clarke wants Matthew Hayden as consultant coach for clueless-looking Aussies","Matthew Hayden, who worked with Pakistan during their run to the T20 World Cup final, could be of assistance for the current Aussie side according to Michael Clarke, wrote Fox news.","While Australia coach Andrew McDonald doubled down rejecting suggestions the team was not prepared well enough for the tour of India, calls are growing for the Aussies to bring Matthew Hayden on as a coaching consultant owing to his experience in Asia.
Hayden, who worked with Pakistan during their run to the T20 World Cup final, could be of assistance for the current Aussie side according to Clarke, wrote Fox news.
India retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy inside sox days with dominant wins at Nagpur and Delhi, leaving Australia needing a draw or win in the remaining two Tests to make the World Test Championship final.
Former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden. (Source: AP)
Clarke joined calls for Matthew Hayden, who has 30 Test centuries including two in India, to be brought into the Aussie support staff. ‚ÄúLook at the staff. Are we getting enough help here? Do we need some more advice, guidance?‚Äù he told Sky Sports Radio‚Äôs Big Sports Breakfast show.
‚ÄúSomething so simple. You‚Äôve got Matthew Hayden in India at the moment commentating and Mark Waugh as well. They‚Äôre at the ground. So it‚Äôd be a no-brainer to go to someone like Matthew Hayden, who is a massive sweeper. He‚Äôs probably the only Australian batsman that has had success sweeping in India.
It was Haydos‚Äô commentary stint refrain that left Clarke urging for him to be brought into the fold. ‚ÄúMatty Hayden said it a hundred times on commentary yesterday, ‚ÄòBoys, I wouldn‚Äôt be sweeping here, don‚Äôt sweep, don‚Äôt sweep, don‚Äôt sweep‚Äô. These batters, go and talk to Haydos, who‚Äôs a sweeping genius, because he‚Äôs telling you not to sweep.
‚ÄúI feel we‚Äôre a little bit nervous to get outside help because it might be a little critical.

‚ÄúI think if you just stay in your bubble in situations like this, that‚Äôs where it gets harder because you keep making the same mistakes and the fans get crazier. Do some things to try and get better, that‚Äôs what we need to try to do,‚Äù he added.
Australia‚Äôs Alex Carey plays a sweep shot during the third day of the second cricket Test match between India and Australia in New Delhi. (AP)
Hayden was critical of the Aussies‚Äô over-use of sweep shots during their third innings capitulation, explaining on the Cricket Et Cetera podcast: ‚ÄúThe ball not going over the stumps means you can only sweep on line.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to see what the Indian batsmen do and that‚Äôs come down to the ball. Once you start moving your feet, then they might start tossing it wide, then the sweep shot might be an option.

Centre set to ban sugar exports for first time in 7 years: Report,"India is expected to ban mills from exporting sugar in the next season beginning October, halting shipments for the first time in seven years, as a lack of rain has cut cane yields, three government sources said.","India is expected to ban mills from exporting sugar in the next season beginning October, halting shipments for the first time in seven years, as a lack of rain has cut cane yields, three government sources said.
India‚Äôs absence from the world market would be likely to increase benchmark prices in New York and London that are already trading around multi-year highs, triggering fears of further inflation on global food markets.
‚ÄúOur primary focus is to fulfil local sugar requirements and produce ethanol from surplus sugarcane,‚Äù said a government source who asked not to be named in line with official rules. ‚ÄúFor the upcoming season, we will not have enough sugar to allocate for export quotas.‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
India allowed mills to export only 6.1 million tonnes of sugar during the current season to Sept. 30, after letting them sell a record 11.1 million tonnes last season.
In 2016, India imposed a 20% tax on sugar exports to curb overseas sales.
Monsoon rains in the top cane growing districts of the western state of Maharashtra and the southern state of Karnataka ‚Äì which together account for more than half of India‚Äôs total sugar output ‚Äì have been as much as 50% below average so far this year, weather department data showed.
Patchy rains would cut sugar output in the 2023/24 season and even reduce planting for the 2024/25 season, an industry official, who declined to be named, said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Local sugar prices jumped this week to their highest level in nearly two years, prompting the government to allow mills to sell an extra 200,000 tonnes in August.
‚ÄúFood inflation is a concern. The recent increase in sugar prices eliminates any possibility of exports,‚Äù said another government source.
Retail inflation in India jumped to a 15-month high of 7.44% in July and food inflation to 11.5% ‚Äì its highest in over three years.
ADVERTISEMENT
India‚Äôs sugar production could fall 3.3% to 31.7 million tonnes in the 2023/24 season.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve allowed mills to export large volumes of sugar during the past two years,‚Äù said the third government source. ‚ÄúBut we also have to ensure sufficient supplies and stable prices.‚Äù
India surprised buyers last month by imposing a ban on non-basmati white rice exports. New Delhi also imposed a 40% duty last week on exports of onions as it tries to calm food prices ahead of state elections later this year.
A Mumbai-based dealer with a global trade house said lower output in Thailand was also expected to reduce shipments and major producer Brazil would alone not be able to fill the gap.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-ban-sugar-exports-first-time-7-years-8905857/,business

"Dipa Karmakar reacts to doping ban, says she ‚Äòcan‚Äôt wait to get back on the floor‚Äô","India‚Äôs star gymnast, who has been serving a suspension for a 21-month period after testing positive for higenamine, says she doesn‚Äôt know how the substance entered her body.","India‚Äôs star gymnast Dipa Karmakar has confirmed that she has been serving a doping suspension for a 21-month period, effective until 10 July, 2023. She had tested positive for higenamine.
Higenamine, a stimulant, is listed under Beta-2 Agonists, (of the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list). According to anti-doping literature of the US Anti-Doping Agency, higenamine acts as a general stimulant. It helps the lungs to take in more oxygen and is prohibited in and out of competition.
Reacting to a statement from International Testing Agency (ITA) regarding her ban, Karmakar put out a statement on Twitter saying: ‚ÄúIn October 2021, my sample was obtained for out-of-competition testing and sent for assessment. The result was positive for a banned substance which I unknowingly ingested and could not determine the source of. I decided to take a provisional suspension with the hope of a swift resolution with the international federation. I am happy that the matter has been amicably resolved.‚Äù
üôè pic.twitter.com/LolR80zayc
‚Äî Dipa Karmakar (@DipaKarmakar) February 4, 2023
Karmakar says she doesn‚Äôt know how the banned substance entered her body and it‚Äôs something that has caused her immense stress.
‚ÄúIt has been distressful to not know how the substances entered my body, however, more so to be in a position where my ethics have been questioned. Never in my career has the thought of consuming a banned substance crossed my mind. Gymnastics is all I have, and I would never do anything which would bring myself or my country into disrepute,‚Äù she said.

When Prahlad Kakkar made Paintal literally put his head in a lion‚Äôs mouth by getting him drunk on rum,"Prahlad Kakkar recalled working on a series of ad films in the 70s, one of which required actor to put his head in a lion's mouth.","Ad guru Prahlad Kakkar recalled a campaign that he spearheaded in the 1970s, which involved putting the comedic actor Paintal‚Äòs head literally inside a lion‚Äôs mouth. Of course, the actor wasn‚Äôt particularly excited to do this, but Prahlad narrated the story of how he got him to agree, and the darkly humorous interaction that he had with the client behind the campaign.
In a chat with Cyrus Broacha on the sidelines of the launch of his autobiography, one of Prahlad‚Äôs old colleagues brought up the lion story, and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if you remember this, but in 1977 or 78, you were doing an ad for Bush radios.

‚ÄòAkshay Kumar was in tears‚Äô: Samrat Prithviraj director says he and actor have learnt not ‚Äòto tamper with history‚Äô after film failed,Chandraprakash Dwivedi said that Akshay Kumar had tears in his eyes after the failure of Samrat Prithviraj. The director said that producer Aditya Chopra ignored his suggestions during the making of the film.,"In 2022, when Akshay Kumar played the titular role in YRF‚Äôs Samrat Prithviraj, directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi, it was expected to be a film that would bring back the audience to the theatres after the dry spell of the pandemic but, it backfired and how! Two years later, the director has now opened up about the colossal failure of the movie and expressed how he raised many objections to producer Aditya Chopra during the making but since he did not have much power, he could not control the situation.
In a conversation with Mukesh Khanna on his YouTube channel, Dwivedi said that even before the release of the movie, the audience had picked up on many elements of the film and were criticising it. ‚ÄúThey were objecting to how Akshay was looking in the film. One of the objections was about how the actress (Manushi Chillar) was so much younger and Akshay, who was 55 then, was playing the role of a 26-year-old king. Then there was a question about his moustache as to why did he not have a real moustache. They even said that the frame of his body was nothing like Prithviraj. Today, honestly, I would like to confess that most of these objections were right,‚Äù he said.

OpenAI fixes ‚Äòlazy‚Äô GPT-4 Turbo model and drops pricing,OpenAI slashes prices for GPT-3.5 Turbo and boosts GPT-4 Turbo performance.,"OpenAI has released several updates to its AI models and pricing, marking the latest in a series of incremental improvements by the research company. The changes include lower pricing for its popular GPT-3.5 Turbo model, a performance boost for GPT-4 Turbo, and upgraded text embedding models.
Most notably, OpenAI has cut the per-token pricing of GPT-3.5 Turbo by 50% for input and 25% for output. This model powers applications like ChatGPT and serves as an industry benchmark for conversational AI. Lower prices make the API more accessible for developers building text-intensive products that require analysing documents or books. With open-source models catching up to OpenAI, reduced pricing helps retain customers.
GPT-3.5 Turbo also gains a new version 0125 with unspecified ‚Äúimprovements.‚Äù Since the last iteration was 0613, some may have expected more details on advancements from OpenAI.
For GPT-4 Turbo, a new preview model 0125 arrives that OpenAI says ‚Äúcompletes tasks like code generation more thoroughly‚Äù to reduce ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù where the model avoids finishing work. This fix aims to boost performance on technical tasks compared to previous versions. GPT-4 with vision capabilities remains in preview but will launch more broadly in coming months.
On the technical side, upgraded text embedding models provide better semantic representations of language for researchers and engineers.
While not earth-shattering, OpenAI‚Äôs latest tweaks reflect the company‚Äôs iterative approach to enhancing its AI lineup.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-fixes-lazy-gpt-4-model-and-drops-pricing-9128794/,technology

"Adani family sells $1 billion stake to GQG, other investors","The group's flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd saw 18 million shares, or 1.6 per cent, trade in a single block while the renewable energy firm Adani Green Energy saw a total 35.2 million shares, or 2.2 per cent, change hands.","US-based boutique investment firm GQG Partners and other investors have bought close to USD 1 billion of additional stakes in Adani group companies as billionaire Gautam Adani continues to rebuild market confidence since hit by a damning report of a US short seller.
The investors bought 18 million, or 1.6 per cent, from the Adani family in the group‚Äôs flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd in a single block trade. In the renewable energy firm Adani Green Energy, a total of 35.2 million shares, or 2.2 per cent, changed hands, sources aware of the matter said.
Stock market data showed large block trades in both companies in early Wednesday trading.
GQG Partners has been ramping up its investment in the conglomerate ever since Hindenburg Research in a bombshell report alleged accounting fraud and stock price manipulation at the Group, triggering a stock market rout that had erased about USD 150 billion in its market value at its lowest point.
Adani Group has denied all allegations by Hindenburg and is plotting a comeback strategy that includes recasting its ambitions, scrapping acquisitions, pre-paying debt to address concerns about its cash flows and borrowings and scaling back its pace of spending on new projects.
In March, promoters sold stakes worth Rs 15,446 crore (USD 1.87 billion) in four group companies to GQG Partners. GQG ramped up that investment with an additional purchase of shares worth USD 400-500 million in May.
GQG investments anchored the Adani group‚Äôs recovery from the losses sparked by Hindenburg, though all 10 companies are still trading below the levels before the January 24 report.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sources said the block trade in Adani Enterprises was transacted at Rs 2,300, a premium to its closing price of Rs 2,281.75 on the BSE on Tuesday. For Adani Green, the trades were priced at Rs 920 to Rs 924.75, a discount to Tuesday‚Äôs closing price of Rs 959.90.
On Wednesday, Adani Enterprises closed 5.3 per cent higher at Rs 2,403.65 but Adani Green fell as much as 6.8 per cent before erasing most of its losses to trade 0.16 per cent lower at Rs 958.40.
In May, boards of Adani Enterprises Ltd and electricity transmission company Adani Transmission Ltd approved raising up to Rs 21,000 crore (over USD 2.5 billion) through share sales to qualified institutional investors.
ADVERTISEMENT
This comes after Adani Enterprises was forced to abort a Rs 20,000 crore follow-on public offering (FPO) in the wake of the Hindenburg report.
The offer was fully subscribed but the company returned the money to subscribers. The sources said the company stock which was offered in the price range of Rs 3,112 to Rs 3,276 in the FPO is now available at a much lower price.
The funds that Adani Group is raising will be used to pare debt as well as fund the group‚Äôs expansion projects.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/adani-family-sells-1-bn-stake-ggq-other-investors-8690188/,business

Brent crude futures climbed 69 cents, or 0.7%, to $93.96 a barrel by 0646 GMT after settling 3 cents lower on Friday.

‚ÄúCrude oil prices have started the week on the front foot, as the market continues to digest Russia‚Äôs temporary ban on diesel and gasoline exports, into an already tight market, offset with the Fed‚Äôs hawkish message that rates will stay higher for longer,‚Äù IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore said.
Both contracts fell last week, snapping a three-week winning streak, after a hawkish Federal Reserve stance rattled global financial sectors and raised oil demand concerns.
Prices had rallied more than 10% in the previous three weeks on forecasts of a wide crude supply deficit in the fourth quarter after Saudi Arabia and Russia extended additional supply cuts to the end of the year.
Last week, Moscow temporarily banned gasoline and diesel exports to most countries in order to stabilise the domestic market, fanning concerns of low products supply especially for heating oil as the Northern Hemisphere heads into winter.

‚ÄúThe Russian fuel export ban news appears to be priced in for the time being but the undercurrent of global oil supply tightness runs deep, with an intense focus on diesel shortages and fears over unanticipated LNG supply disruptions likely to persist, especially in the European markets,‚Äù said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights.
In the United States, the number of operating oil rigs fell by eight to 507 last week, their lowest since February 2022, despite higher prices, a weekly report from Baker Hughes showed on Friday.
Expectations of better economic data this week from China, the world‚Äôs largest crude importer, also lifted sentiment. However, analysts flagged that oil prices face technical resistance at the November 2022 highs that were hit last week.

China‚Äôs manufacturing sector is expected to return to expansion mode in September, with the purchasing manufacturing index forecast to rise above 50 for the first time since March, Goldman Sachs analysts said.

In an interview with Film Companion, she was asked if Merry Christmas was difficult leap for her, after having played ‚Äòmorally upright‚Äô women in most of her past films. She said, ‚ÄúJust because a lot of the films I‚Äôve been a part of haven‚Äôt portrayed that, it doesn‚Äôt mean that me as a person doesn‚Äôt understand it, or doesn‚Äôt relate to it, or hasn‚Äôt experienced it. A lot of it came from discussions with Sriram sir. After our first meeting, where he narrated the film, he told me to write my own backstory for the character. He said, ‚ÄòTell me what you think, where she came from, who she is, why she does what she does‚Äô. That process really helped me understand the world‚Ä¶‚Äù

The Crown season 6 review: Obsession with William and Kate‚Äôs romance brings Netflix‚Äôs once-regal show to anticlimactic end,"The Crown season 6, part 2 review: In a baffling act of self-sabotage, Netflix's once-regal show gives the Queen an extended cameo in its final season, instead of a proper send-off.","Monarchies and television shows; both should ideally have sound exit strategies in place before their time is up. Some of the greatest programmes in history have set fire to their reputations because of substandard final episodes. And for Netflix‚Äôs The Crown ‚Äî like its subject, the last remaining survivor of a bygone era ‚Äî the pressure to nail the landing is doubly difficult. Faced with glossier, more algorithmically savvy competition, the show‚Äôs popularity in recent years has dwindled like the monarchy itself.
Much of The Crown‚Äôs final season ‚Äî or, to be precise, the six episode second part ‚Äî is dedicated to the idea of clean exits. The Queen, played one last time by the under-appreciated Imelda Staunton, spends most of the final episode pondering her own death, and the episodes before that ‚Äî at least the ones she‚Äôs in ‚Äî wondering if the monarchy has become obsolete. She agrees to introduce some reforms at the advice of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who, in addition to representing the existential threat that it faces, also identifies the crown‚Äôs many extravagances. These frivolities, he suggests politely, might be contributing to the public‚Äôs growing alienation from the royals.

A ghostlike dusty galaxy appears again in James Webb Space Telescope image,An elusive ghost of a galaxy has been spotted using the James Webb Space Telescope.,"Scientists first saw it as a glowing blob and then in images from the Hubble Space Telescope before it vanished completely from the telescope‚Äôs eye.

The dust dates back to nearly one billion years after the Big Bang. Scientists used to believe earlier that such galaxies were quite rare in that era of the universe.

The importance of Campbell Johnstone coming out as gay: The first All Black,"""The public will know that there is one in amongst the All Blacks"".","Former New Zealand rugby player Campbell Johnstone became the first All Black to come out as gay, saying he hoped to ‚Äútake away the pressure and the stigma‚Äù of doing so publicly.
The 43-year-old said spoke bravely in a Seven Sharp TV interview, and his decision was met with support and gratitude from the larger rugby community, with hopes that his visibility and strength in talking about being gay, will pave the way for others in a sport that is saddled with an excessively macho image and stereotypes. Here‚Äôs why Johnstone is being hailed by all.
When did Johnstone make the All Blacks squad?
The former tighthead prop debuted against Fiji as All Black #1056 and played three Tests in 2005, with his last two matches against the British and Irish Lions. Between 2002 and 2012, he made 38 appearances for the Crusaders, 72 for Canterbury and 105 for the French side Biarritz.
Why this is big and of immense importance and exceedingly difficult earlier?
Johnstone explained that while he had told friends and family ‚Äúa long time ago‚Äù that he was gay, he kept the matter private during his playing career, leading a ‚Äúdouble life‚Äù and ‚Äúliving a lie‚Äù because his sexuality did not fit with ‚Äúhis image of an All Black,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWithin myself, I was never really comfortable with the whole concept,‚Äù said Johnstone. ‚ÄúMy dream was to be an All Black.‚Äù
How did he visualize an All Black player for the national side back then?
ADVERTISEMENT
Johnstone said he thought of All Blacks as someone who was ‚Äúmanly, strong ‚Ä¶ possibly had a wife, kids‚Äù, and he blamed his sexuality when he played poorly, according to NZ Herald. ‚ÄúManly, strong, possibly had a wife and kids. I‚Äôd pushed that side of me down deeper and deeper; I‚Äôve been to some interesting places with that. It would come to the surface and I may have had a bad game, and I would look at that side of me and blame that for it. It slowly starts to affect you. It‚Äôs hard living a double life, or living a lie,‚Äù he said.
Why did he feel the need to come out?
In the same interview he would say he realised he was living ‚Äúa double life‚Äù and ‚Äúliving a lie,‚Äù trying to portray the stereotypes of a rugby player. He continued: ‚ÄúWe had a phrase in rugby saying if you could look yourself in the mirror and be honest with yourself then you‚Äôve done enough. Here I was looking in the mirror, haven‚Äôt been honest with my teammates; and that puts a lot of pressure on and just builds up on you.‚Äù
What did Johnstone say about his decision?
‚ÄúIf I open up that door and magically make that closet disappear, then we‚Äôre going to help a lot of people.‚Äù He added that previously he wanted to keep his sexuality private. ‚ÄúTelling close friends and rugby mates was enough for me. I‚Äôm very happy and comfortable about myself,‚Äù he told Seven Sharp.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no rule, there‚Äôs no law about coming out. You don‚Äôt have to come out. If you feel it‚Äôs not right for you, then don‚Äôt. The idea of an ideal rugby player or Crusader, is of an honest, strong person. The stronger you are, and if you can make yourself stronger by relieving anxiety and stress, then you can fit that mould.
‚ÄúIn some part I‚Äôm disappointed it‚Äôs taken me so long to do this, then there‚Äôs the other aspect that I‚Äôm somewhat maybe a little bit sad we are actually having to do this. If I open up that door and magically make that closet disappear then we‚Äôre going to help a lot of people.‚Äù It was about shattering the ultimate stereotype: ‚ÄúThe public will know that there is one in amongst the All Blacks.‚Äù
What were the reactions?

‚ÄúNew Zealand‚Äôs sports minister, Grant Robertson, who is also gay, said Johnstone had blazed a trail for the national team ‚Äì which is dominant on the world stage, venerated at home and has become a multi-billion dollar global brand,‚Äù wrote NZ Herald. He wrote on Instagram: ‚ÄúThere is still a long way to go, but feels like a very significant step,‚Äù Robertson wrote in an Instagram post. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to create an inclusive environment in sport at all levels, and that starts at the top. In the Black Ferns we have had role models for the Rainbow community for some time. And now with the All Blacks another barrier has been broken. I hope it inspires future generations to be open, happy and comfortable. There is still a long way to go, but feels a very significant step. And from one prop to another, nga mihi Campbell!‚Äù
In a message posted on Twitter, Mark Robinson, the CEO of New Zealand Ruby and a former teammate of Johnstone‚Äôs, said the former player‚Äôs ‚Äústrength and visibility will pave the way‚Äù for other players.
‚ÄúWe know that there are people who have not always been comfortable to be who they are in rugby,‚Äù Robinson wrote. ‚ÄúWe want to be clear, no matter who you love, rugby has your back.‚Äù
Is Johnstone New Zealand‚Äôs first international to come out?
ADVERTISEMENT
No, Johnstone is not New Zealand‚Äôs first international rugby player to come out. The national women‚Äôs team ‚Äì has multiple openly gay current and past players in Black Ferns, including Louisa Wall, a former member of parliament who was part of the winning side at the 1995 Women‚Äôs Rugby World Cup. ‚ÄúBut it has been much rarer for men in the sport‚Äôs top echelons to come out publicly. In 2009, the former Wales captain Gareth Thomas became the first openly gay professional rugby union player in the World,‚Äù NZH wrote.
What did the players‚Äô community say?
All Black scrum-half Brad Weber tweeted: ‚ÄúLegend! Hugely influential moment for so many young people, rugby players especially, who might be questioning their sexuality. Much respect, Campbell.‚Äù
The All Blacks shared support for Johnstone as the segment went to air, praising him for ‚Äúhaving the courage to share his story and helping create a more inclusive game.‚Äù
World Cup-winning Black Fern Ruby Tui shared a message of support for Johnstone. ‚ÄúI try to fight for the rainbow every day but what Campbell Johnson has just done for the rainbow community within rugby is probably more than I‚Äôve ever done. Thank you brother,‚Äù she wrote on Twitter.

Microsoft says compromise of its engineer‚Äôs account led to Chinese hack of US officials,"Microsoft said the engineer's account had been penetrated by a hacking group it dubs Storm-0558, which is alleged to have stolen hundreds of thousands of emails from top American officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.","The recently disclosed Chinese hack of senior officials at the U.S. State and Commerce departments stemmed from the compromise of a Microsoft engineer‚Äôs corporate account, Microsoft Corp said in a blog post on Wednesday.
Microsoft said the engineer‚Äôs account had been penetrated by a hacking group it dubs Storm-0558, which is alleged to have stolen hundreds of thousands of emails from top American officials including Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Kritenbrink.
The blog post addressed some unanswered questions around the incident, which drew fresh scrutiny to Microsoft‚Äôs security and led to calls to investigate the company‚Äôs practices.

Notably, the post explained how hackers were able to extract a cryptographic key from the engineer‚Äôs account and use it to access email accounts that it should not have given them access to.
Microsoft said it had fixed the flaws that led to the key being accessible from the unidentified engineer‚Äôs account which gave the hackers such wide latitude to steal emails. A Microsoft representative said the engineer‚Äôs account had been hit using ‚Äútoken-stealing malware‚Äù but did not provide further detail about the incident or its timing.

"Matthew Hayden masterclass on sweep shot. When Hayden asked Harbhajan Singh, ‚Äòhow is my ability now?‚Äô","The story of how Hayden, who has offered to help the current Australians, consciously worked on his sweep shot for the 2001 Test series in India","It was a sight for the ages, the tall huge Matthew Hayden swiftly going down on his knee to repeatedly hammer the sweep shot against Harbhajan Singh and co. in the 2001 Test series in India. He was on air during Australia‚Äôs harakiri by sweep last week on a low surface at Delhi and moved to blurt out, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sweep on this surface‚Äù. As if he couldn‚Äôt understand what his eyes revealed to him.
Another man in Australia, Allan Border, was sharper with his assessment: ‚ÄúThey panicked, and you can‚Äôt tell me that the reverse sweep or sweeping on that sort of pitch is the ideal way of scoring your runs,‚Äù he told Fox Cricket.
It was Border, along with the coach Bob Simpson, who had kickstarted Hayden‚Äôs tryst with the sweep all those years back. In fact, the seed was planted not in some four-day camp ahead of the series but a decade back in 1993.
Australia‚Äôs Alex Carey plays a sweep shot during the third day of the second cricket Test match between India and Australia in New Delhi. (AP)
‚ÄúThe seed was planted in 1993 when I was working with Allan Border and Bob Simpson. Border was a very good sweeper as well and I got the foundation of it from him: understanding when and how, what lines to play, and picked his mind on that,‚Äù Hayden had once told this correspondent. ‚ÄúHave you thought about the sweep shot?‚Äô They taught me the basics of it ‚Äì keeping the head in line of the ball, hitting through the ball and also when not to hit it.‚Äù
And then, two years before the famous Test series, came a seminal spin‚Äôs camp in 1999 in Chennai where Hayden ran into the Indian greats Erapalli Prasanna and Bishen Singh Bedi. That changed Hayden‚Äôs game against spin to another level.
‚ÄúIt [the spin camp] was a very important camp. Based on that experience, I was able to formulate a game plan and batting strategy,‚Äù Hayden said. ‚ÄúImportantly, I came to understand the mindset of a spinner. I practised a variety of shots, tried out lots of options and developed my game against spin.‚Äù Incidentally, Todd Murphy, the off spin bowler who troubled India at Nagpur, too had been to a spin camp in Chennai last year. But back to Hayden.
Clarke joined calls for Matthew Hayden, who has 30 Test centuries including two in India, to be brought into the Aussie support staff.
Prasanna had once shared what he and Bedi had taught and observed in Hayden.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe told him, ‚Äòeither you take the ball on the full or wait‚Äô. And we also talked about his sweep shot,‚Äù Prasanna said. ‚ÄúSome batsmen usually take the left leg out and expose the middle stump. We asked Hayden to get in line a bit more before he plays that shot forcefully. He was obviously a very keen student.‚Äù Hayden would pull out the sweep when the ball began to turn, to put doubts in the umpire‚Äôs minds in the pre-DRS era that it could be missing the stumps, when it hit the pad.
Hayden‚Äôs attacking game against spin began to take shape. ‚ÄúI had a solid defensive strategy but what I came prepared to was to have an attacking strategy with that sweep. I prepared hard for that and sweeping was a strategy. It has been copied around the world now really. Most left-handers now look to play that sweep as a go-to shot to scoring,‚Äù Hayden said.
The spin camp wasn‚Äôt the end of it. Just before he came to India in 2001, Hayden would ask Ross Harris, then the curator at the Allan Border Field in Queensland, to replicate Indian conditions for his sweep-shot practice. Days were spent honing the shot.Hayden also opened the bat-face bit more than what he would do in Australia ‚Äì ‚Äúyou tend to close the bat‚Äôs face in Australia because you don‚Äôt want anything angling across the bat and get caught out in the slips‚Äù.

Hayden‚Äôs sweep shot too was a touch different from the likes that Joe Root, say, employs. The bat-parallel-to-the-ground sweep, as played often by Root who sweeps the entire arc from wide mid-on to backward square-leg after crouching really low with the bat coming from the side of the ball, almost.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hayden would smash the ball from the top; the bat would come crashing down on the ball to negate the bounce. Like England‚Äôs former captain Graham Gooch, who once swept India out of the 1987 world cup, would do.
‚ÄúYou can handle the extra bounce with this movement ‚Äì swooping down from the top. It helps keep the ball down somewhat and this top-to-bottom sweep also allows a batsman to rotate strike. You can access the areas safely,‚Äù Gooch once told this newspaper.

‚ÄúIf you want to hit the ball for a six, then you go from low to high with the bat flow,‚Äù Gooch says. ‚ÄúThe bat also comes out differently for a lap or when you want to keep it along the ground and where you want to hit it ‚Äì behind square or front of square. So, all these decisions you have to take in the semi-premeditative shot and based on what comes out of the hand. You can‚Äôt be lazy with this shot.‚Äù
Gooch has a length in mind to pull out the sweep shot. ‚ÄúMy principle was that the ball I tried to sweep is the same I would play a forward defensive to. The kind of ball that can potentially hit the splice of the bat, too, you would want to lap or sweep them. Also, important to mix things up. Not be unidimensional with the sweep. In my career, I have tried to play a mixed game to the turning ball ‚Äì sweep, occasional use of the feet, backfoot nudges, laps. I didn‚Äôt look to attack all the time ‚Äì barring that ‚Äô87 semi-final game.‚Äù

One final story for the road, from Hayden. In that 2001 series, he played a tour game and came against Harbhajan Singh, but interestingly he says he chose to hide the fact that he could sweep and attack. It was a game against India A in Nagpur where Harbhajan picked five wickets in the match (2 and 3 respectively in both innings) and Hayden hit 49 and 37.
‚ÄúMy battles with Harbhajan [Singh] started in a warm-up game. I didn‚Äôt want to give him any indication of my abilities. So, I had a very defensive game plan and I wanted to see if I could survive against him without revealing my arsenal. He came up to me and politely mentioned just how disappointed he was that a player of my credentials was even considered to play for Australia. I took all that on board and he actually dismissed me that day as well,‚Äù he once told Bcci.tv. ‚ÄúI think off his second or third ball in the Test, I came down the wicket and hit him with ease over extra-cover and asked him, ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs my ability now?‚Äô‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-matthew-hayden-masterclass-on-sweep-shot-when-hayden-asked-harbhajan-singh-8463786/,sports
India says IMF debt warning a worst case scenario,"The IMF, in a so-called article IV review, said India's general government debt, which includes federal and state government debt, could be 100% of GDP under adverse circumstances by fiscal 2028.","The Indian government said on Friday a warning from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the country‚Äôs debt to GDP ratio could hit 100% was a worst-case scenario, and not a ‚Äúfait accompli‚Äù.

"29,273 bogus firms, GST evasion of Rs 44,015 crore detected since May ‚Äô23","In terms of fake firms per lakh registered firms, Haryana leads among the states/UTs with 81 bogus firms per lakh registered firms, followed by Delhi with 61 fake firms per lakh registered firms, Rajasthan with 59 such firms per lakh registered firms and Maharashtra with 54 fake firms per lakh registered firms.","Goods and Services Tax (GST) authorities have detected 4,153 bogus firms involved in suspected evasion of input tax credit (ITC) worth around Rs 12,036 crore during October-December 2023, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement Sunday. While Maharashtra is in the top spot among 36 states and union territories (UT) with the highest number of 926 bogus firms having undertaken suspected tax evasion of Rs 2,201 crore, the evasion incidence has turned out to be higher in Delhi with Rs 3,028 crore of suspected tax evasion by 483 bogus firms.
In terms of fake firms per lakh registered firms, Haryana leads among the states/UTs with 81 bogus firms per lakh registered firms, followed by Delhi with 61 fake firms per lakh registered firms, Rajasthan with 59 such firms per lakh registered firms and Maharashtra with 54 fake firms per lakh registered firms.
Out of the total 4,153 bogus firms detected during the October-December quarter, 2,358 were detected by Central GST authorities. ‚ÄúThis has helped protect revenue of Rs 1,317 crore, out of which Rs 319 crore has been realised and Rs 997 crore has been protected by blocking input tax credit,‚Äù the Ministry statement said, adding that overall 41 persons have been arrested in these cases, of which 31 arrests were by Central GST Authorities.
ADVERTISEMENT
GST authorities under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) along with state/UT governments have been undertaking action against bogus firms to curb frauds and increase compliance. Tax authorities have undertaken special drives on the issue of non-existent/bogus registrations and issuance of fake invoices without any underlying supply of goods and services.
The special drive against fake registrations under GST began in mid-May last year. The Indian Express had reported in April last year about several such instances of evasion by bogus firms such as a company showing manpower supply from Gujarat to Bihar for services, instead of supply of goods, to avoid generating e-way bills which are mandatory for inter-state transportation of goods worth at over Rs 50,000. There were also instances of Aadhaar of businesses getting linked to mobile numbers of random individuals, who then started getting OTPs, multiple GST registrations originating from the same premise, with fake documents produced in many of these cases. These instances of frauds came under the radar of tax authorities under the GST regime, prompting them to initiate a special drive against registration-linked frauds in 2023-24 after discussions having taken place at the top level in the government.
Since then, a total 29,273 bogus firms involved in suspected Input Tax Credit (ITC) evasion of Rs 44,015 crore have been detected, the Ministry said. ‚ÄúThis has saved Rs 4,646 crore of which Rs 3,802 crore is by blocking ITC and Rs 844 crore is by way of recovery. So far, 121 arrests have been made in the cases,‚Äù it said.
With no major GST rate tweaks expected before the general elections, which are likely to happen in the next few months, in a bid to bolster revenue collections, tax authorities have identified registration-linked frauds as one of the key focus areas for tighter scrutiny in the financial year 2023-24. The government has taken various measures for the GST registration process. Pilot projects of biometric-based Aadhaar authentication at the time of registration have also been launched in the states of Gujarat, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh.
ADVERTISEMENT
The government has also taken measures to curtail evasion such as sequential filing of GST returns, system generated intimation for reconciliation of the gap in tax liability in GSTR-1 & GSTR- 3B returns and of the gap between ITC available as per GSTR-2B and ITC availed in GSTR-3B returns, use of data analytics and risk parameters for detection of fake ITC among others.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/29273-bogus-firms-gst-evasion-of-rs-44015-crore-detected-since-may-23-9099304/,business

FIFA World Cup 2030: Saudi Arabia reportedly offered to bear costs of Greece and Egypt in audacious joint bid,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly offered to pay for the construction costs of stadiums that Greece and Egypt might need to host games, but on the condition that 75 percent of the event is hosted by the Gulf nation.","Fresh on the heels of their neighbours Qatar hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022, Saudi Arabia have stepped up their own audacious joint bid to host football‚Äôs showpiece event in 2030, which, if successful, will see the event being held in three continents. The rich nation has reportedly offered to pay for the construction costs of stadiums that Greece and Egypt might need to host games, but on the condition that 75 percent of the event is hosted by the Gulf nation. It is estimated that the costs that Saudi Arabia has to fork out would run into billions of dollars.
According to a report in Politico, the offer was made by Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, in a conversation with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis last year. The report added that the bid was hoping to garner votes from nations in three continents as all of FIFA‚Äôs Congress. The FIFA Congress consists of over 200 nations, all of who vote to decide who wins the right to host the World Cup.
The three nations are said to be working on a joint bid for the 2030 World Cup, even though the report added that that there was no certainty if the offer was accepted. Media reports have said that Spain, Portugal and Ukraine are expected to submit a joint bid while the South American nations of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile could also join forces to launch a bid.
The joint bid is the latest move by the Gulf nation to make an imprint in the world of sports. Recently, a Saudi consortium led by the nation‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, called the Public Investment Fund, bought Premier league side, Newcastle United.

"Wrestling row: WFI appears before probe committee, denies all allegations","India lost the hosting rights of the Asian Championship after wrestlers submitted a written complaint to UWW, the world governing body of the game, about the alleged misconduct of the WFI chief.","The sidelined WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh on Tuesday appeared before the government-appointed oversight committee, which is investigating into sexual abuse allegations against him, and outrightly rejected all the charges.
The Committee, led by legendary boxer MC Mary Kom, was formed on January 23 to investigate into the claims made by country‚Äôs top wrestlers that Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) boss Brij Bhushan has sexually harassed several women wrestlers, intimidates the athletes and run the sport body in an autocratic manner.
Brij Bhushan arrived with his 20-odd supporters for the meeting which went on for nearly three hours.
‚ÄúBrij Bhushan appeared before the committee today. He straightaway denied all the allegations. He said he never did anything wrong,‚Äù a sports ministry source told PTI.
Brij Bhushan, however, evaded the waiting media at the SAI headquarters here, saying the investigation is still on and he won‚Äôt like to make any comment at this point of time.
The allegations were levelled by prominent grapplers such as Vinesh Phogat, Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Ravi Dahiya. The wrestlers have already deposed before the committee.
In January, the country‚Äôs top wrestlers had staged a three-day sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar, demanding that Brij Bhushan be removed and WFI be disbanded.

Google slipping? New study finds decline in search result quality,New study suggests Google is losing search quality as low-value SEO spam creeps into top results.,"Google has long dominated the world of online search. However, a new study suggests that the search giant may be slipping when it comes to providing users with quality results.
Researchers from Leipzig University, Bauhaus-University Weimar, and the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence recently completed a year-long study analysing search results from not just Google but Bing and DuckDuckGo as well. The study looked specifically at product review searches ‚Äì an area of increasing concern. The results confirm what many frequent searchers have noticed: the top results for product queries are increasingly littered with low-quality content from sites focused on gaming search algorithms.

Watch how hackers use Flipper Zero to spam iPhone users with Bluetooth pop-ups,Flipper Zero can be used to send several annoying Bluetooth pop-ups on iOS devices like iPhone and iPad and render the devices nearly unusable.,"Flipper Zero, a tiny piece of hardware that can interact with any type of RFID, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled devices can be used by hackers to spam iPhone users with relentless Bluetooth pop-ups by imitating devices like AirPods, AppleTV, and AirTags.
According to a recent report by TechCrunch, a security researcher named ‚ÄòAnthony‚Äô demonstrated a denial of service attack using Flipper Zero, sending several Bluetooth pop-ups on the victim‚Äôs phone which rendered it almost unusable. It is to be noted that the attack can be imitated on any iOS device.
The exploit worked without any issues even when Bluetooth was turned off from the Control Center or the device was in airplane mode, but when the radio was turned off from the ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô app, Flipper Zero couldn‚Äôt bombard the iPhone with pop-ups.
ADVERTISEMENT
The security researcher said he modified the Flipper Zero firmware to imitate ‚ÄòBluetooth Advertisements‚Äô, which is basically a type of transmission that Apple uses to connect devices like an Apple Watch or send pictures using file-sharing features like AirDrop. He went on to claim that the attack can also work over a wide range using an amplified board, but refused to share details citing security reasons.

TechCrunch says it used the firmware shared by Anthony to display a phone number transfer dialogue using Flipper Zero, with the device capturing several iPhones at the same time even when it was kept on the other side of the room.
A blog post on GitHub by ‚ÄòTechryptic‚Äô suggests Flipper Zero can be programmed to carry out wireless attacks not only on iPhones, but can also target other devices like RFID cards and smart car keys.
While Flipper Zero requires users to be in proximity to the device, the attacks demonstrated by the security researcher give us an idea of how such exploits could be used to steal information from Apple devices.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/flipper-zero-iphone-spam-bluetooth-pop-ups-8928952/,technology

"Salman Khan on perception that he doesn‚Äôt work hard on set: ‚ÄòThey think I drink coffee, look here and there, leave‚Äô","Salman Khan reflected on his journey before entering the film industry, highlighting the extensive groundwork he puts into his projects even before they commence filming.","Salman Khan, known for his action-packed films, is currently witnessing box office success with his latest project, Tiger 3. In a recent conversation, the actor reflected on his journey before entering the film industry, highlighting the extensive groundwork he puts into his projects even before they commence filming.
Speaking at a recent press conference, Salman opened up about his struggling days before he entered the film industry and said, ‚ÄúPeople say that we will put in all the work after we get the film. All these things, I have done much before I came into the industry. The four-five years of struggle that I did before I came into the industry, before I did films like Maine Pyar Kiya and Biwi Ho To Aisi. After that also, whenever I sign a movie, I have to like it in the first narration. If I like a film, I shift that film before my other projects. And the projects that I have postponed, they will likely not happen. Until that time, I won‚Äôt sign another film. That is what I usually concentrate on.‚Äù
Talking about how he has to maintain a disciplined lifestyle and put in a lot of hard work before reaching the set, Salman said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see you guys catching me anywhere, no parties and nothing. I shoot and I go back home. All the discussions that I have are either on Being Human, which is mostly about family stuff, friends and movies. The hard work is done at home with the director. That‚Äôs why on the set it is perceived as, ‚ÄòThis man comes, looks here and there, drinks coffee, gives the shot and leaves.‚Äô But all the work has been done before I land up on the set. I don‚Äôt believe in going out and gossiping, bitching about people and following the box office numbers of other films. I don‚Äôt believe in that.‚Äù

In an earlier interview with Bollywood Hungama, Kubbra Sait, who starred in Salman‚Äôs 2011 film Ready, spoke about how the actor reached on set at 2 or 3pm while everybody waited for him since morning and immediately announced lunch break. She said, ‚ÄúFinally Salman Khan walks in, then he flexes his muscles and says ‚Äòlunch break.‚Äô Subha se sirf do apple khaye the maine socha ‚Äòlunch he kar lete hai (I‚Äôd just eaten two apples all day, and even though I was wondering when work would start, I thought let‚Äôs eat).‚Äô‚Äù 
Tiger 3, co-starring Katrina Kaif, has achieved success with a global collection of Rs 420 crore. However, despite being Salman‚Äôs most significant hit in the last six years, the film couldn‚Äôt meet the anticipated box office success due to its hefty budget of Rs 300 crore. The film will face further competition from Ranbir Kapoor‚Äôs Animal and Vicky Kaushal‚Äôs Sam Bahadur, which will hit the theatres on December 1.

Maybe he‚Äôll have a good IPL, maybe he won‚Äôt but he deserves that Indian team number 3 spot whenever that comes.

Finance Ministry to hold key meet on trade payment issues on February 5,"This comes a week after the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had asked the DFS to maintain credit flow to the exporters amid disruption in the Red Sea region that could impact over 80 per cent of the exports to Europe, following an inter-ministerial meeting on January 17.","The Finance Ministry is set to hold a high-level meeting on February 5 to ensure smooth trade payments amid challenges emanating due to disruption in the Red Sea region. Payment settlement mechanisms for the disrupted trade routes along with pending issues relating to vostro accounts are likely to be taken up in the meeting, officials said.
The meeting, which is to be chaired by Department of Financial Services (DFS) Secretary Vivek Joshi, will be attended by officials from the ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry, External Affairs, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
‚ÄúIt is a coordination meeting planned between government departments, regulators and banks to discuss trade related payment issues. Objective is to hear from all stakeholders and find solutions for orderly trade transactions and settlement thereof,‚Äù a senior government official told The Indian Express.

This comes a week after the Ministry of Commerce and Industry had asked the DFS to maintain credit flow to the exporters amid disruption in the Red Sea region that could impact over 80 per cent of the exports to Europe, following an inter-ministerial meeting on January 17.
Freight rates to Europe have more than doubled due to security tension in the Red Sea region. Fears of disruptions in the Red Sea region have risen and oil prices have begun inching up ever since the US and the UK earlier this month attacked Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for the attacks on their commercial ships in the Red Sea region.
Indian shipments of low value products such as agriculture and textiles to Europe are primarily expected to face the impact of disruption in the Red Sea region due to surging freight costs.

Sathiyan focusing on mixed doubles with Manika Batra in Olympics lead-up as singles too tough,"However, training time with Manika limited as both have separate schedules and academies.","A WTT Star Contender held in India is where star paddler G Sathiyan would normally want to give his all and take advantage of home comforts to reach the tournament‚Äôs later rounds and improve his world ranking.
Since 2019, he‚Äôs been driven to maintain his place among the top 50 in the world, with entering the top 20 his ultimate target.
On Wednesday at the WTT Star Contender Goa at the Peddem Indoor Stadium in Mapusa though, there was a shock in store for him. He‚Äôs used to being in the main draw of singles events, but low ranking meant he had to go through qualifying after not getting a wildcard. He won his first round of qualifiers, but then suffered a shock 3-2 (7-11, 11-7, 6-11, 11-7, 8-11) loss to World No.194 Vincent Picard in a topsy-turvy match.
Normally, he would be distraught after such a loss, but Sathiyan just shook off the disappointment, came to the practice arena, and asked his mixed doubles partner, India‚Äôs top-ranked women‚Äôs paddler Manika Batra, when she was free to train.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm definitely giving more importance to mixed doubles in the lead-up to the Olympics. It‚Äôs ok that my singles ranking has been going down,‚Äù said Sathiyan, who has dropped to World No. 94.
The Olympics have mixed doubles as a separate category and the Sathiyan-Manika pair, ranked No.11 in the world, is poised to qualify for the Paris Games. Ever since they started playing together in 2021, they‚Äôve had a phenomenal run, beaten top opponents, and even reached as high as World No.5 at one point. It makes them serious medal contenders in the French capital.
‚ÄúWe have a fair chance and an Olympic medal is an Olympic medal. You win that and it could change the face of the game. I wanted to focus on mixed doubles more where we have a chance in Paris. So Manika and I are trying hard. We aren‚Äôt in great shape right now but know that one win can change anything. Two wins in Paris and we win a medal. Right now my goal is that,‚Äù Sathiyan told The Indian Express.
Right after Olympics!

‚Äî Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) August 20, 2021
He also has no qualms in admitting that he‚Äôs choosing mixed doubles over singles as he doesn‚Äôt stand a chance of medalling in the latter event.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúTo be honest, it will be very difficult to win a medal in singles. I‚Äôve participated once, maybe I could go two rounds further but still, you are two to three rounds away from a medal chance. I have to accept I am not as physically strong as the top athletes. My game is not that high yet and so it‚Äôs better I concentrate on something where I stand a chance at winning,‚Äù he said.
The conundrum
Though he‚Äôs nursing knee and lower back injuries and physiotherapists have advised him to rest, Sathiyan says that the World Table Tennis (WTT) calendar has become so packed that taking a break could hurt his chances of qualifying. That‚Äôs why he is only choosing to play mixed doubles at top-tier events instead of trying to improve his singles ranking.
‚ÄúI missed a lot of WTT Feeder events ‚Äì which could‚Äôve been beneficial for my singles ranking ‚Äî in favour of playing mixed doubles at Contender and Star Contender events. I had to take a call as my body isn‚Äôt allowing me to play everything,‚Äù he says.

While Sathiyan has given up hope of qualifying in singles, Manika is likely to make it to the main draw of the Olympics and has to continue playing top events to keep her spot. It means they barely get any time to train together but Sathiyan says it‚Äôs imperative they find a way to do so.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve barely trained together for a total of 15 days in the last year. We‚Äôre trying to have a more robust training schedule. It‚Äôs not that easy because she has a personal coach and I also have mine. We have occasions when we‚Äôve trained together in Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai. Right now, all we can manage is short camps of 4-5 days,‚Äù he says, adding that having a national centre where they can train anytime would be hugely beneficial for the national team. It would allow them to train with their partners whenever they want rather than having to coordinate with their respective academies and coaches to book training slots.

Argentina‚Äôs World Cup-winning captain and France‚Äôs superstar forward head the three-player shortlist announced by FIFA on Friday, eight weeks after leading their teams in an epic final in Qatar.
Karim Benzema completed the top three in the voting by a global panel of national team captains and coaches plus selected journalist in each of FIFA‚Äôs 211 member countries, as well as fans voting online.
In the Best Women‚Äôs Player award, Beth Mead of England, Alex Morgan of the United States and Spain‚Äôs Alexia Putellas were on the shortlist voted for by a separate global voting panel.
The winners will be announced at a Feb. 27 ceremony in Paris.
Messi edged Mbapp√© for the Golden Ball awarded by FIFA as the best player at the World Cup. Croatia captain Luka Modriƒá placed third in that contest.
Another duel is expected for the Paris Saint-Germain teammates with Messi favored to get a seventh win in FIFA‚Äôs annual individual prize. Mbapp√© seeks his first.

Messi won his six previous awards when it was called the FIFA World Player of the Year (2009), the FIFA Ballon d‚ÄôOr in each year from 2010-12 and again in 2015, then in the current title of Best FIFA Men‚Äôs Player for 2019
Mbappe makes the shortlist for the first time though he was fourth in voting for the 2018 award. The 24-year-old has been sixth, seventh and eighth in past three years.
Robert Lewandowski won the FIFA award for the past two years.
The more prestigious Ballon d‚ÄôOr award organized by France Football magazine was won in October by Karim Benzema ahead of the World Cup. The France forward missed the tournament because of an injury. Messi was not on the long list of Ballon d‚ÄôOr candidates announced in August.

The Best Women‚Äôs Player award for 2021 was won by Putellas and the Barcelona playmaker made the top three again despite being injured days before the European Championship and missing the tournament for Spain.
Mead led England to the Euro 2022 title as the tournament‚Äôs joint top scorer and was named its best player. She suffered a serious knee injury in November playing for Arsenal and could miss the Women‚Äôs World Cup that starts in July, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.

He also questioned their decision to not play a tour game.
Australia prepared for the tour at North Sydney Oval, followed by a short training camp in India.
‚ÄúIdeally, they should have played a tour game,‚Äù he told SMH.
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt like to do that because the tour match we played last time was on a green wicket.
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs still batting for a long period of times in the heat and getting used to the ball, things like that. So a tour game would have been handy ideally, but they decided to do the BBL, but maybe they needed a tour game.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy in hindsight, though, isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù
Leaving Head out a mistake
The fÔªøormer coach called the the decision to omit Travis Head from the first Test in Nagpur as ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot playing Head was ridiculous, and he could have bowled some extra overs. The hardest thing for him now is how is he going to try and stay in the side after having such an amazing two years at home, ‚Äù Lehmann said.

Domestic air passenger traffic to grow 8-13% this fiscal: Icra,"Domestic air passenger traffic is likely to grow 8-13 per cent in the current fiscal and the aviation industry is also expected to trim the losses further, credit rating agency Icra said on Thursday.","Domestic air passenger traffic is likely to grow 8-13 per cent in the current fiscal and the aviation industry is also expected to trim the losses further, credit rating agency Icra said on Thursday.
Icra, in its mid-year update on Indian aviation, also maintained a ‚Äústable outlook‚Äù on the industry, amidst the continued recovery in domestic and international air passenger traffic in FY2024, and improved pricing power of the carriers.
After the fast-paced recovery in FY2023, Icra said it estimates growth in domestic air passenger traffic in FY24 at 8-13 per cent, thus reaching 150-155 million passenger traffic, surpassing the pre-Covid levels of 141.2 million passengers in FY2020.
ADVERTISEMENT
It said that the domestic air passenger traffic during the first five months of the current fiscal stood at 63.2 million, witnessing a year-on-year growth of 20 per cent from 52.6 million a year earlier and 7 per cent higher than the pre-Covid levels of 58.9 million (5M FY2020).
The international passenger traffic for Indian carriers, according to the ratings agency, surpassed the pre-Covid levels in FY2023, although it trailed the peak levels of 25.9 million in FY2019.
It is expected to cross this level in the current fiscal, with an estimated 25-27 million passengers, Icra said.
‚ÄúGiven the fast-paced recovery of air passenger traffic in FY2023 and continuation of the same in the current fiscal, coupled with improved pricing power, the RASK-CASK spread of some of the Indian airlines turned positive since Q3 FY2023,‚Äù Suprio Banerjee, Vice President and Sector Head for corporate ratings at Icra Limited, said.

‚ÄúThe industry is thus estimated to report a significantly lower net loss of Rs 30-50 billion in FY2024 compared to an estimate of Rs 170-175 billion in FY2023,‚Äù he added.
Moreover, the industry witnessed a better pricing power, as reflected in improved yields and thus the revenue per available seat kilometre ‚Äì cost per available seat kilometre (RASK-CASK) spread of the airlines, Icra said.
The pricing power is expected to continue with a YoY decline in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices since April 2023 (notwithstanding the recent uptick) and relatively stable foreign exchange rates, the rating agency said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/domestic-air-passenger-traffic-to-grow-8-13-this-fiscal-icra-8929062/,business

"Ashwin rises to 2nd spot in ICC Test bowlers rankings, Jadeja makes significant gains",The spin duo haunted Australia in the first Test between by sharing 15 wickets between them as India won by an innings 132 runs inside three days.,"India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin on Wednesday jumped to the second spot in the ICC Men‚Äôs Test Bowlers Rankings following his eight-wicket show against Australia in the opening Test in Nagpur.
Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, who made a successful comeback after almost five months due to a knee injury, has moved up to the 16th position, courtesy his player-of-the-match winning effort in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series-opener.
The spin duo haunted Australia in the first Test between by sharing 15 wickets between them as India won by an innings 132 runs inside three days.
Star performers from the Nagpur and Bulawayo Tests make significant gains in the latest @MRFWorldwide ICC Men‚Äôs Test Player Rankings üìà
Details üëáhttps://t.co/QRn72RdBtd
‚Äî ICC (@ICC) February 15, 2023
Ashwin ensured India wrapped up a stunning victory before tea on the third day, as the veteran off-spinner took 5/37 in the second innings to go with 3/42 earlier in the match.
The 36-year-old is 21 rating points behind Australia captain Pat Cummins and is contention to return to the No.1 ranking for the first time since 2017.
While Ashwin stepped up in what turned out to be the last session of the Test, Jadeja did the damage on the first day with 5/47, including the prized wickets of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne.
Jadeja then took 2/34 in the second Australian innings. Australia were bowled out for just 91.
Among other Indian bowlers, pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who too has been out of action since September last due to a lower back stress fracture, is placed fifth.

In the Test batting chart, India captain Rohit Sharma has been rewarded for his match-defining ton in Nagpur. He gained two spots to be at number eight.
Rohit came to the crease after Australia were all out for 177 in their first innings, then made the wicket look all-but tame with an assured 120 that set the tone for the rest of the match.
Wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant, who will be out of action for an indefinite period following his horrific car accident, is the other Indian batter in top-10. He is placed seventh.
In contrast Australian openers David Warner and Usman Khawaja have paid the price for being dismissed cheaply twice.

Warner has fallen six places to 20th after his scores of 1 and 10, while Khawaja has dropped two spots to 10th after only making 1 and 5 in the first Test.
Australian duo of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith occupy the top two position with Pakistan captain Babar Azam in the third spot.
India all-rounder Axar Patel has leaped six places to seventh in Test all-rounder rankings after coming to the crease at a tense 240 for 7. He hit a patient 84 for his highest score in the format.

"Markets log gains for 3rd day on buying in Reliance, Infosys","Sun Pharma emerged as the biggest gainer from the Sensex pack, climbing 2.09 per cent, followed by ITC, Titan, Bajaj Finance, Nestle, Infosys, L&T, JSW Steel, Reliance Industries and Kotak Mahindra Bank.","Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty closed higher for the third straight day on Tuesday on gains in market heavyweights ITC, Reliance Industries and Infosys amid a bearish trend in global equities.
Besides, robust domestic macroeconomic data added to the positive momentum, traders said.
The BSE benchmark index climbed 152.12 points or 0.23 per cent to settle at 65,780.26. During the day, it gained 203.56 points or 0.31 per cent to 65,831.70.

The Nifty rose 46.10 points or 0.24 per cent to end at 19,574.90.
‚ÄúStrong domestic factors are providing crucial support for Indian equities, allowing them to maintain their strength despite attempts by weak global peers to disrupt the mood. India‚Äôs service PMI remains robust at 60.1, indicating sustained demand even in the face of inflationary pressures.
‚ÄúNotably, small and mid-cap stocks have been standout performers, with both indices reaching all-time highs. Conversely, the weak Chinese service PMI has cast a shadow on hopes of an economic rebound in China, impacting global market sentiments,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

UltraTech Cement, Maruti, HDFC Bank, Wipro, State Bank of India and NTPC were among the laggards.
‚ÄúMarkets held on to gains for the 3rd straight day but strong follow-through buying was, however, missing albeit lack of positive Asian cues. The positive takeaway was that the benchmark Nifty stuck to gains as Nifty Mid-cap and Small-cap indices continued to scale fresh all-time highs.
‚ÄúThe risk mood has improved after Friday‚Äôs softer than expected US August payrolls report which suggests that September rate hike is off the table,‚Äù Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said.

In the broader market, the BSE midcap jumped 1.09 per cent, and smallcap gained 0.61 per cent.
Sectorally, healthcare rallied 1.29 per cent, realty climbed 1.08 per cent, energy (1.01 per cent), consumer durables (0.90 per cent), oil & gas (0.83 per cent) and services (0.72 per cent).
Financial Services, telecommunication and bankex were the laggards.
‚ÄúGlobal equities mostly fell on Tuesday as higher Treasury yields weighed on growth stocks, while a slow pace of expansion in services activity in China (8-month low) stoked worries over demand in the world‚Äôs second-largest economy,‚Äù Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities, said.
In Asian markets, Tokyo settled in the green, while Seoul, Shanghai and Hong Kong ended in the negative territory.
European markets were trading on a mixed note in early deals. The US markets were closed on Monday.
‚ÄúWhile markets extended gains for the third straight session, the mood was more or less range-bound with a positive bias as US markets were shut on Monday and investors preferred to take selective bets. One needs to be watchful about the sharp volatility in the rupee, which could impact FII flows going ahead,‚Äù Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities Ltd, said.

"Man United slip up in draw with Everton, Chelsea go top of WSL","The Blues moved into first position on 31 points, two ahead of United and five ahead of Manchester City after 12 games. Arsenal, who are fourth on 25 points with two games in hand over the top three, take on West Ham United later on Sunday.","Manchester United‚Äôs title hopes suffered a setback as they were held to a scoreless draw at home by Everton on Sunday, allowing Chelsea to replace them at the top of the Women‚Äôs Super League table after a cracking 3-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur.
The Blues moved into first position on 31 points, two ahead of United and five ahead of Manchester City after 12 games. Arsenal, who are fourth on 25 points with two games in hand over the top three, take on West Ham United later on Sunday.
On a frustrating afternoon for United, Ella Toone hit the post in the first half as the home side created several good chances but Everton, fifth in the table, showed steely resolve to keep them at bay.
The Toffees‚Äô Irish international keeper Courtney Brosnan combined some superb saves with the occasional slice of luck as she kept a clean sheet, with her best stop denying Katie Zelem midway through the second half.
In London, Tottenham striker Beth England scored against her former club but it wasn‚Äôt enough to stop Chelsea from going back to the top thanks in part to a superb solo goal from Lauren James that helped secure the three points.
England, who joined Spurs from Chelsea in January, cancelled out Jess Carter‚Äôs eighth-minute opener for the Blues, but James crowned a mazy run from the right wing by drilling a calm finish to put them in front again.

"WhatsApp web may get a new sidebar, revamped dark mode and option to create usernames","WhatsApp web might soon get new features like a revamped dark mode, a new sidebar and others that will help enhance privacy and improve the overall app experience.","WhatsApp web, the browser version of the messaging platform is all set to get a bunch of new features. This includes a new sidebar, a redesigned dark mode and the option to create a username for your profile from the web client itself.
Earlier this year in October, WhatsApp was reportedly testing a new username feature that will make sharing phone numbers a thing of the past. However, the functionality was limited to a handful of users and was only available on the mobile version of the app.
Now, a recent report by WABetaInfo suggests the developers are working to extend the functionality to the web client as well. Similar to the desktop version, users will be able to modify their username anytime they want to.

Currently, WhatsApp web shows the ‚ÄòCommunities‚Äô, ‚ÄòStatus‚Äô, ‚ÄòChannels‚Äô and ‚ÄòNew Chat‚Äô buttons at the top left of the window, but the new sidebar will shift it to the left of the browser window so users can easily switch between various tabs.
As for the revamped Dark mode, the developers have changed the background colour to match the aesthetics of the dark theme and help reduce eye strain.
All the aforementioned features are currently under development and available to those on the beta version of the app, with WhatsApp planning to make them available in a future version of the app.
While the current web version of WhatsApp lacks several functionalities compared to the mobile and desktop apps, the developers seem to be trying to bridge the gap and improve user experience by constantly adding features from the mobile app.

‚ÄòA picture I‚Äôll post in my house‚Äô: West Indies debutant Shamar Joseph after picking Steve Smith‚Äôs wicket on first ball in Test cricket,"Born in Baracara, on the banks of the winding Canje River in Guyana and only accessible through a five-hour boat ride, Shamar hadn't even played a first-class match until February last year. ","Earlier on Wednesday, Shamar Joseph had told his teammates that he was going to pick a wicket off his very first delivery in Test cricket.

Steaming in to bowl from over the wicket, Shamar had already fumbled and abandoned his run up midway through his first attempt. The nerves were jangling, as he‚Äôd concede later, ‚Äúbowling to one of the best batsmen in the Australian team‚Äù.

"Fire still burning, Djokovic and GOAT debate move on to Paris","That debate may never be settled but if it is to be decided purely in terms of major championship success, it now moves on to the French Open in the European spring with the Serbian and Rafael Nadal tied on 22 titles.","A triumphant Novak Djokovic paraded the Australian Open trophy around the gardens of Melbourne‚Äôs Government House on Monday, his 10th title having added another notch in the plus column for those who argue he is the Greatest Of All Time (GOAT).
That debate may never be settled but if it is to be decided purely in terms of major championship success, it now moves on to the French Open in the European spring with the Serbian and Rafael Nadal tied on 22 titles.
While the blue courts of Melbourne Park are undoubtedly Djokovic‚Äôs domain, the red clay courts of Roland Garros are the preserve of Spaniard Nadal, the other open-era GOAT contender along with 20-times Grand Slam champion Roger Federer.
Federer is now retired and sent his congratulations to Djokovic on Instagram ‚Äì ‚ÄúIncredible effort, again!‚Äù ‚Äì but Nadal was back in Spain being treated for the latest in a series of injuries that have blighted his career.

The 36-year-old is confident he will recover from the hip flexor issue he sustained at the Australian Open in time to drag his battered body to Paris in May in a bid for a 15th French Open title.
And, despite a hamstring issue that hindered him throughout the year‚Äôs first Grand Slam, Djokovic left little doubt that he would also be there trying to win major number 23.
‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs still a lot of that fire inside of me that is burning of passion for the sport and for competition and I think that‚Äôs what allows me to still push myself to the limit,‚Äù he said on Monday. ‚ÄúIn the practice sessions, day in, day out after so many years to go through the same routines, repetitively, that sometimes is not so interesting.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúBut I know that there is always a greater goal and a guiding star, so to say, and this trophy is one of those guiding stars, it‚Äôs something that I always strive to achieve.‚Äù
While the resilience shown by Djokovic and Nadal means men‚Äôs tennis can continue to enjoy the back end of the most glittering of golden eras, women‚Äôs tennis continues with its first season trying to fill the void left by Serena Williams.
The American, when fit, dominated the women‚Äôs game for the best part of two decades while hoovering up 23 Grand Slam singles titles ‚Äì a tally only bettered by Australian Margaret Court (24) mostly in the amateur era.

Even if Djokovic‚Äôs opposition to COVID-19 vaccines keeps him out of the U.S. Open for a second year running, Sunday‚Äôs title put him firmly in touching distance of those tallies.

CD Projekt aims to start production phase of ‚ÄòPolaris‚Äô in 2024,"CD Projekt did not give a premiere date for the first game in the project, but analysts expect it to debut in 2026 or 2027.","Polish video game maker CD Projekt aims to start the production phase of the next game in its blockbuster ‚ÄúWitcher‚Äù series this year, the company‚Äôs new joint CEO Adam Badowski told Reuters.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to have around 400 people working on the project by the middle of the year‚Äù, Badowski said.
Badowski, a company veteran, took the helm at CD Projekt along with Michal Nowakowski at the start of the year.
The project, called ‚ÄúPolaris‚Äù, is a new trilogy expanding the universe of the ‚ÄúWitcher‚Äù medieval fantasy franchise, which has sold over 75 million copies since the first game was released in 2007.
CD Projekt did not give a premiere date for the first game in the project, but analysts expect it to debut in 2026 or 2027.
That leaves the company without major game release in the next couple of years.
After a bug-ridden launch of another game ‚ÄúCyberpunk 2077‚Äù in late 2020, CD Projekt has been focused on transforming its studio. It has announced plans for several new games and said in October that Cyberpunk‚Äôs sales had exceeded 25 million copies.
ADVERTISEMENT
A sequel to Cyberpunk, code-named ‚ÄúOrion‚Äù, is in the conceptual phase, Badowski said. CD Projekt expects to have about 80 people working on the project by the end of the year.
Nowakowski added the company was considering including multi-player elements, but would not discuss details.
He said wage pressures had eased and the company expected hiring in its Polish studios to be ‚Äúrather low‚Äù, but it would continue expanding its North America studio.
He added CD Projekt had formed a team to look into how it could use AI.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe think that AI is something that can help improve certain processes in game production, but not replace people,‚Äù he said.
Speaking about lessons learnt from Cyberpunk‚Äôs release, Badowski said the company now had better control of the game production process.
‚ÄúWe believe that in the future we‚Äôll avoid a premiere like the one we faced with Cyberpunk 2077‚Äù, Badowski said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/cd-projekt-aims-to-start-production-phase-of-polaris-in-2024-9122186/,technology

Manoj Bajpayee on lack of independent content on OTT platforms: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a sad development‚Äô,"Manoj Bajpayee said it is unimaginable for independent films to get funding at par with tentpoles such as Jawan, Pathaan or Tiger 3.","New voices should be applauded and given a platform, said Manoj Bajpayee on Friday as he lamented the lack of mentorship provided by the streaming services to independent filmmakers.
During a panel discussion at the 54th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) here, the actor said when the streaming services started in India, they backed independent storytellers but now these platforms are giving priority to blockbuster films.
‚ÄúOne thing that all streaming services started with initially was that they were making independent cinema but that got lost somewhere. For some reason, it has gone down completely and now we see blockbuster films making their way big time.

‚ÄúBut the independent cinema movement that started and was getting such mentorship from the OTT platforms, is gone. And that is a very sad development,‚Äù Bajpayee said.
If there is no independent cinema, then the Indian film industry will not evolve, he stressed.
‚ÄúWe will only grow in terms of money but we will not grow as creative people. New voices should be applauded and given platforms. I think they were doing so beautifully well earlier,‚Äù he added.

Manoj Bajpayee said it is unimaginable for independent films to get funding at par with tentpoles such as Jawan, Pathaan or Tiger 3.
‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt stand a chance and if you‚Äôre giving shows at 9 am for an independent film, it will never do well. It will fall flat. I really request from this stage to all these platforms that they should revive that mentorship,‚Äù the actor said.

Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK, the co-creators of Bajpayee‚Äôs popular OTT series The Family Man, agreed with Bajpayee.
‚ÄúEarlier, all these films were directly made or shown on OTT. Now it is a clause that it has to play in theatres and only then we will take it,‚Äù Nidimoru said.
Krishna added, ‚ÄúThis is happening worldwide right now. There used to be a time when there would be a film and then there would be an OTT movie. But The Russo Brothers made The Gray Man for Netflix and it is as big as any theatrical film. So now every film is a big film.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no safe home left for independent films and that is happening because a lot of resources are going into the blockbusters. I believe independents help filmmakers to become better show creators and directors,‚Äù she said.
Raj Nidimoru said being an independent filmmaker taught him and Krishna DK to be self-sufficient.
‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know anyone in the industry, we taught ourselves. So this whole package of indie cinema gave us the confidence that wherever you give us, we can make a film, irrespective of the budget and the stars. I think that‚Äôs what still keeps us going,‚Äù he said.
Krishna believes independent filmmaking helps in coming to terms with the fact that ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt get everything you want‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou kind of adapt then, I think jugaad is the word. You somehow get the job done and that‚Äôs how we started making films‚Ä¶ Then this OTT and series concept came to India.

"Matthew Perry died from the effects of ketamine, autopsy report says","The medical examiner said the levels of ketamine in Perry‚Äôs body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldn‚Äôt explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours.","Matthew Perry died from the acute effects of the anesthetic ketamine, according to the results of an autopsy on the 54-year-old ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù actor released Friday. The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said in the autopsy report that Perry also drowned in ‚Äúthe heated end of his pool,‚Äù but that it was a secondary factor in his Oct. 28 death, deemed an accident.People close to Perry told investigators that he was undergoing ketamine infusion therapy, an experimental treatment used to treat depression and anxiety.
But the medical examiner said the levels of ketamine in Perry‚Äôs body were in the range used for general anesthesia during surgery, and that his last treatment 1 1/2 weeks earlier wouldn‚Äôt explain those levels. The drug is typically metabolized in a matter of hours.
The report says coronary artery disease and buprenorphine, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, also contributed.The amount of ketamine detected ‚Äúwould be enough to make him lose consciousness and lose his posture and his ability to keep himself above the water,‚Äù said Dr. Andrew Stolbach, a medical toxicologist with Johns Hopkins Medicine who reviewed the autopsy report at the request of The Associated Press.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúUsing sedative drugs in a pool or hot tub, especially when you‚Äôre alone, is extremely risky and, sadly, here it‚Äôs fatal,‚Äù said Stolbach, who noted that both ketamine and buprenorphine can be used safely.Perry was declared dead after being found unresponsive at his home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Investigators performed the autopsy the following day. The actor had taken drugs in the past but had been ‚Äúreportedly clean for 19 months,‚Äù according to the report.
Perry had played pickleball earlier in the day, the report says, and his assistant, who lives with him, found him face down in the pool after returning from errands. The assistant told investigators Perry had not been sick, had not made any health complaints, and had not shown evidence of recent alcohol or drug use.Postmortem blood tests showed ‚Äúhigh levels‚Äù of ketamine in his system, which could have raised his blood pressure and heart rate and dulled his impulse to breathe. Buprenorphine, commonly used in opioid addiction and found in therapeutic levels in Perry‚Äôs blood, could have contributed to the breathing problem, the autopsy said. It would have been risky to mix the central nervous system depressant with ketamine ‚Äúdue to the additive respiratory effects when present with high levels of ketamine,‚Äù according to the autopsy report. The report said his coronary artery disease would have made him more susceptible to the drugs‚Äô effects.
Perry was among the biggest television stars of his generation when he played Chandler Bing alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC‚Äôs megahit sitcom ‚ÄúFriends.‚ÄùHis castmates, like many of his friends, family and fans, were stunned by his death, and paid him loving tribute in the weeks that followed. Perry was open about discussing his struggles with addiction dating back to his time on ‚ÄúFriends.‚Äù
‚ÄúI loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame,‚Äù he wrote in his 2022 memoir. ‚ÄúI had a secret and no one could know.‚Äù A woman whose name is redacted in the autopsy report told investigators that Perry had been in good spirits when she spoke to him a few days earlier, but had been taking testosterone shots which she said were making him ‚Äúangry and mean.‚Äù She said he had quit smoking two weeks earlier.The woman said he had been receiving the ketamine infusions for his mental health, and that his doctor had been giving them to him less often because he had been feeling well.Ketamine is a powerful anesthetic approved by U.S. health regulators for use during surgery, but in the past decade it has emerged as an experimental treatment for a range of psychiatric and hard-to-treat conditions, including depression, anxiety and chronic pain.While not approved by regulators, doctors are free to prescribe drugs for these alternate uses if they think their patients could benefit, and hundreds of clinics across the U.S. offer ketamine infusions and other formulations for various health conditions.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/matthew-perry-autopsy-ketamine-9070363/,entertainment

"‚ÄòHigh inverted duty structure, raw material cost curbing competitiveness‚Äô: Engineering goods exporters to parliamentary standing committee on commerce",An inverted duty structure refers to a situation where taxes on input items are higher compared to the final product resulting in a drag in export competitiveness.,"At a time when India is negotiating free trade agreements (FTA) with highly competitive markets such as the UK and European Union, Indian engineering goods manufacturers have explicitly flagged the issue of inverted duty structure in GST rates and the high raw material costs draining their competitiveness. An industry group representing over 12,000 engineering goods exporters said this is a submission to the parliamentary standing committee on commerce last month.
An inverted duty structure refers to a situation where taxes on input items are higher compared to the final product resulting in a drag in export competitiveness. India has already signed a limited trade deal (an early harvest deal) with Australia and a comprehensive trade deal with the UAE, where duties are among the lowest in the world. Exporters, thereby, are faced with stiff rivalry from established players, especially the Chinese, for market access, despite the duty elimination following the trade deal.

Disastrous year in China
Apple has experienced a catastrophic 2023 in China ‚Äì a massive blow considering the country accounts for nearly 20% of the tech giant‚Äôs revenue, second only to the US. After enjoying market dominance for years, Apple has faced intense competition from homegrown phone makers like Xiaomi and Oppo.

In fact, Huawei overtook Apple‚Äôs iPhone for the no.1 spot in smartphone market share this year, according to the research firm Canalys.

Adani Group forms JV for marketing of green hydrogen in Japan,"Adani Group on Thursday said it has formed a 50:50 joint venture with Japanese conglomerate Kowa Group for sale of green hydrogen in Japan, Taiwan and Hawaii markets.","Adani Group on Thursday said it has formed a 50:50 joint venture with Japanese conglomerate Kowa Group for sale of green hydrogen in Japan, Taiwan and Hawaii markets.
Billionaire Gautam Adani-led conglomerate is investing up to USD 50 billion over the next 10 years in setting up a fully integrated green hydrogen ecosystem in India. This includes the production of 1 million tonne of green hydrogen in the initial phase which will be ramped up to 3 million tonne later.
‚ÄúAdani Global Pte Ltd, Singapore, a step-down wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Ltd, announced a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with Kowa Holdings Asia Pte Ltd, Singapore for sales and marketing of green ammonia, green hydrogen and its derivatives. The JV will concentrate on marketing of products in Japan, Taiwan and Hawaii,‚Äù the group said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hydrogen is a clean energy source. It is mainly used in the refining and chemical sectors and produced using fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. Green hydrogen is produced by using electricity from renewable sources such as solar, to power an electrolyzer that splits the hydrogen from water molecules.
Adani already is the largest renewable energy producer and for the green hydrogen project, it plans to expand its solar module manufacturing capabilities at Mundra SEZ in Gujarat to up to 10 GW per annum. The Mundra factory would manufacture metallurgical grade (mg) silicon, polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and the module itself that are used to generate electricity from solar energy.
Sea water will be desalinated before using its electrolyzers to produce low-cost green hydrogen.
‚ÄúThe JV with Kowa for green hydrogen marketing is a natural and strategic extension of Adani Group‚Äôs long-standing marketing and trading relationship with Kowa,‚Äù the statement said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Adani New Industries Ltd (ANIL), the green hydrogen platform of Adani Group, is developing end-to-end solutions to produce globally competitive green hydrogen and its associated sustainable derivatives at scale.
‚ÄúThe first project of ANIL of 1 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) green hydrogen is being implemented in phases in Gujarat. The initial phase is expected to start production by FY2027. Depending on market conditions, ANIL aims to increase capacity to up to 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen in the next 10 years, with an investment of about USD 50 billion,‚Äù it said.
After hydrogen is produced, it can either be transported directly (which is a risky and costly affair) or converted to ammonia, often referred to as ‚Äògreen ammonia‚Äô.
ADVERTISEMENT
Clean hydrogen can help decarbonise a range of sectors, including long-haul transport, chemicals, and iron and steel, where it has proven difficult to reduce emissions. Hydrogen-powered vehicles would improve air quality and promote energy security as it produces just water on being burnt in an engine.
ANIL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the group‚Äôs flagship Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL).
‚ÄúANIL‚Äôs strategy is focused on development of an integrated hydrogen ecosystem with three business streams ‚Äì manufacturing of supply chain products (i.e. solar- polysilicon, ingot, wafer, cell & module, wind turbine generator, electrolyzers and ancillary items), green hydrogen generation, and production of downstream derivative products (i.e. green ammonia, green methanol, sustainable aviation fuel and others),‚Äù the statement said.
The combined strength of Adani Group‚Äôs experience in renewable equipment manufacturing, setting up large scale generation projects, building grid infrastructure, and proven project execution capabilities gives it a significant competitive advantage while building the green hydrogen ecosystem in India, it said.
‚ÄúANIL is well positioned to realise its targets and provide green molecules and sustainable fuels at globally competitive cost. Mundra ports‚Äô proximity to global supply chain enables export opportunity of green hydrogen and derivatives, especially considering availability of jetty for shipment of cryogenic products,‚Äù it added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/adani-group-japan-joint-venture-green-hydrogen-marketing-8939590/,business

Brent crude oil futures dipped 6 cents to $90.86 a barrel by 0345 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI), fell 5 cents to $89.18 per barrel.
Data on Tuesday night showed that U.S. job openings increased by the largest amount in more than two years, prompting a further sharp rise in Treasury yields.

Along with fears that interest rates will stay high for some time, oil benchmarks also have been pressured by concerns that the strengthening dollar would dent demand, as it makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.
‚ÄúA resilient labour market is deemed to be providing more room for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to keep rates high for longer,‚Äù said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, or OPEC+, is expected to keep output policy unchanged when it meets on Wednesday, after members Saudi Arabia and Russia extended output cuts to the end of the year.
Saudi Arabia is expected to raise its November official selling price of Arab Light crude to Asia for a fifth straight month, according to a Reuters survey, as market participants expect supplies of medium sour crude to remain tight.

‚ÄúThe recent oil price reversal could be a reason for the cartel to keep their supply cuts unchanged in today‚Äôs review meeting,‚Äù said ANZ Bank‚Äôs analysts Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes in a note.
Meanwhile, talks to restart Iraqi oil exports via a crude oil pipeline that runs through Turkey are still ongoing, an Iraqi oil official told Reuters, one day after Turkey said operations would start again this week following a near six-month stoppage.
Russia is setting no time frame for a fuel export ban it introduced last month, and which will remain in place as long as necessary to stabilize prices and address shortages on the domestic market, Interfax cited Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak as saying.

Investors are also closely watching supply and demand in the United States. Industry data showed crude stocks fell by about 4.2 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 29, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday.
U.S. government data on stockpiles is due on Wednesday.

"GST collection rises 11 % to Rs 1.59 lakh cr in Aug on improved compliance, lower evasion",The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection was over Rs 1.43 lakh crore in August 2022.,"GST collections grew by 11 per cent to over Rs 1.59 lakh crore in August on the back of improved compliance and reduced evasion.
The gross GST revenue collected in August 2023 is Rs 1,59,069 crore of which Central GST is Rs 28,328 crore, State GST is Rs 35,794 crore, Integrated GST is Rs 83,251 crore (including Rs 43,550 crore collected on import of goods) and cess is Rs 11,695 crore (including Rs 1,016 crore collected on import of goods).
‚ÄúThe revenues for the month of August 2023 are 11 per cent higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year. During the month, revenue from import of goods was 3 per cent higher and the revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) are 14 per cent higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year,‚Äù the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection was over Rs 1.43 lakh crore in August 2022.
Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said GST collections have grown more than nominal GDP growth rate in the April-June quarter despite no increase in tax rates.
‚ÄúThis is because of better compliance and improved tax collection efficiency,‚Äù Malhotra said, adding tax evasion and avoidance too have been low.

35% increase in number of Indian students in US: Report,"Study Abroad: Behind China and India, nations sending the most students to the US were South Korea, Canada, Vietnam, Taiwan and Nigeria.","International students have returned to US colleges, fuelled by a surge from India. Students attended US universities in high numbers last year, rebounding from a pandemic slump. There was a 35 per cent jump in students coming from India, according to a study released on Monday.
Overall, the number of international students in the US grew by 12 per cent in the 2022-23 academic year, the largest single-year increase in more than 40 years, according to findings from the State Department and the nonprofit Institute of International Education. More than 1 million students came from abroad, the most since the 2019-20 school year.
‚ÄúThis reinforces that the US remains the destination of choice for international students wishing to study abroad, as it has been for more than a century,‚Äù said Allan E Goodman, CEO of the Institute of International Education.
American colleges enrolled nearly 269,000 students from India, more than ever and second only to China. Most came for graduate programs, often in science, technology and business.

‚ÄúThe US maintains a strong relationship with India on education, which I think is getting even stronger and even more connected,‚Äù said Marianne Craven, the State Department‚Äôs acting deputy assistant secretary for academic exchange.
China still accounted for the most foreign students in the US with 2.90 lakh, but its numbers decreased for a third consecutive year.
It reflects a gradual shift. After years of booming demand from China, interest has ebbed amid chilly international relations and increased competition from universities in the United Kingdom and Canada. Officials behind the new study also blame prolonged travel restrictions in Asia during the pandemic.
At the same time, US universities have focused on recruiting in India, hoping to tap a growing population that the United Nations predicted would overtake China as the world‚Äôs largest this year. Students from India now outnumber those from China in 24 US states, including Illinois, Texas and Michigan, which rank among the top destinations for international students.

For the second consecutive year, America‚Äôs graduate programmes were the main attraction for international students, the study finds. Graduate enrollment grew by 21 per cent, while undergraduate numbers ticked up 1 per cent.
It reverses a trend from the previous decade, which saw undergraduates come in larger numbers.
Much of last year‚Äôs growth is credited to math and computer science programmes, which attracted more students than any other subject and saw a 20 per cent boost in enrollment over the previous year. Engineering and business followed behind. Taken together, those three fields account for more than half of all international students in the United States.
The surge nearly brings international numbers back to their pre-pandemic highs, with a peak of almost 1.1 million students in 2018. Enrollment fell precipitously over the following two years as COVID-19 stifled academic exchange.
The rebound appears to be continuing, with an 8 per cent increase in international enrollment this fall, according to a smaller survey meant to give a snapshot of recent trends.
ADVERTISEMENT
Overall, international students made up just 5.6 per cent of all college students in the 2022-23 year, but they play an outsize role in US higher education. University leaders say they‚Äôre important for global exchange, and they‚Äôre also important for revenue ‚Äî international students are usually charged higher tuition rates, effectively subsidizing college for US students.
Behind China and India, nations sending the most students to the US were South Korea, Canada, Vietnam, Taiwan and Nigeria. Last school year saw a record number of students come from Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Italy, Nepal, Pakistan and Spain.
While more students come from abroad, many colleges are struggling to attract students at home. Total enrollment across all colleges has stayed in a slump in the wake of pandemic decreases, and freshman enrollment decreased by 3.6 per cent in fall 2023, according to a separate study by the National Student Clearinghouse.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/35-increase-in-number-of-indian-students-in-us-report-9024676/,education

Save Lives by Donating Organs echoed as the anthem during the rally held at Parul Sevashram Hospital,"In a bid to spread awareness, the initiative included a theatrical performance and role-play showcasing myths and facts related to organ donation.","Continuing their unwavering dedication to preserving lives, Parul Sevashram Hospital commemorated Organ Donation Awareness Week through an educational initiative aimed at raising awareness about the significance of organ donation. The rally saw active participation from over 500 university students and staff members who united to propagate the life-transforming impact of organ donation. Beyond the rally, a distinguished speaker, Deshmukh Dada, a prominent social activist, addressed the gathering, shedding light on the facts and the current landscape of the field. To provide expert medical insights, the program also featured Dr. Rashesh Desai, a kidney transplant surgeon, who shared invaluable knowledge about kidney transplantation and cadaveric transplants. Parul University‚Äôs comprehensive teaching hospital has been consistently striving to save lives through organ donation.
In a bid to spread awareness, the initiative included a theatrical performance and role-play showcasing myths and facts related to organ donation. These events were held in nearby villages, gardens, and malls. Furthermore, poster and slogan competitions centered around the same theme were organized, including a poster competition in schools to enlighten the upcoming generation about this noble cause. Going the extra mile, the University extended gratitude to the families of organ donors, acknowledging the life-saving commitment made by their loved ones. Over the years, these awareness initiatives have yielded a rising number of individuals pledging organ donation and committing to the cause. Embracing advancing technologies, the institution introduced a mobile application to ensure more frequent organ donation awareness. This app not only disseminates information and insights but also provides an avenue for taking the pledge.
‚ÄúOrgan and tissue donation holds more significance than many realize, impacting society and directly transforming lives. Numerous individuals await organ transplants to attain healthier, more productive lives. Organ donation empowers recipients to lead extended, higher-quality lives. Transplants have the potential to either save lives or significantly enhance their quality. Raising awareness about organ donation is the remedy to this distressing situation. A greater number of potential donors translates to increased availability of organs, poised to save lives. Unfortunately, few in India possess adequate knowledge about organ donation or how they can contribute posthumously. At its core, organ and tissue donation is about aiding people and extending a helping hand. It is our moral duty. Let us pledge that no life in India shall be lost due to a dearth of organs,‚Äù remarked Dr. Komal Patel, Vice President of Parul University and Medical Director at Parul Sevashram Hospital. She also unveiled plans for a special marathon, ‚ÄúRun for Organ Donation,‚Äù scheduled for December 2023. Dr. Patel highlighted the state-of-the-art Kidney Transplant Unit at Parul Sevashram Hospital, which has successfully conducted five live-donor-related transplants under the guidance of an adept team of medical professionals and hospital staff.

Astronomers find oldest black hole and it solves a scientific enigma,Astronomers have found what is the oldest black hole ever discovered. Two NASA telescopes were used to discover the supermassive black hole that was formed more than 13 billion years ago.,"Astronomers say they have found what is the oldest black hole ever discovered. The X-ray quasar was formed around 470 million years after the Big Bang. To put that into context, the Big Bang is thought to have happened about 13.8 billion years ago. The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old.
The supermassive black hole described in Nature Astronomy has about the same as the combined mass of the stars in the galaxy it resides in. Beyond its significance as the oldest known black hole, it also offers proof to suggest that the early universe is ‚Äúseeded‚Äù with heavy black hole seeds with large birth masses that form from direct collapse, according to Yale University.
Direct collapse black holes
For a long time, it was believed that black holes could only form from ‚Äúlight seeds‚Äù that were created by the explosion of stars. But that theory had a ‚Äúproblem of timing.‚Äù The problem was that it did not leave enough time for black holes to grow into the sort of humongous sizes that astronomers are now able to observe really far back in time.

Priyamvada Natarajan, coauthor of the paper, came up with a different theory in 2006. She developed a new model where ‚Äúheavy‚Äù black hole seeds could form in galaxies where star formation was suppressed. These are the satellite galaxies that are close to the galaxies that formed the first stars. In the model, large disks of gas in the satellite galaxies could collapse into heavy black hole seeds and then rapidly merge into their parent galaxies.
Discovered using two NASA telescopes
Fast forward to the present, and researchers combined data from NASA‚Äôs Chandra X-ray telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope to look behind the galaxy Abel 2744. The massive galaxy was acting as a cosmic lens. Essentially, its massive gravity was bending the light coming from behind it in such a way that it was possible to see distant objects behind it better.
The newly-discovered black hole offers compelling evidence to suggest that Natarajan‚Äôs theory that black hole seeds are produced through multiple different scenarios.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/oldest-discovered-black-hole-quasar-9017403/,technology
Freight rates have doubled due to Red Sea disruptions: Official,"This comes after global shipping giant Maersk on Friday decided to extend its diversion of vessels from the Red Sea for the ‚Äúforeseeable‚Äù future, sparking fears of a sharp rise in freight and insurance cost for Indian products.","Freight rates to Europe ‚Äî India‚Äôs second largest export destination ‚Äî via the Red Sea region have almost doubled due to rising attacks along the crucial shipping route, a senior government official told The Indian Express.
This comes after global shipping giant Maersk on Friday decided to extend its diversion of vessels from the Red Sea for the ‚Äúforeseeable‚Äù future, sparking fears of a sharp rise in freight and insurance cost for Indian products.

‚ÄúMultiple things are getting mixed here. Normally, the freight rates range from $500 to $600 through this route to Europe. But the peak season which is between January to March goes up to $1,500. Exporters have informed that this rate has gone to $2,000. Over and above there (war risk) surcharges being added which is taking the freight rates to nearly $3,000,‚Äù the official said.

The Indian Express had earlier reported that exports of low- value products such as textile and agriculture could get hit as exporters are holding back the consignments due to rising freight cost. This comes at a time when Indian textile exports have been on the decline due to weak demand in the West.
Meanwhile, the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that New Delhi must prepare for long term shipping disruptions at the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait.

‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs approach should include looking for alternative trade routes that bypass the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, negotiating contracts for oil and liquified natural gas with alternate suppliers, offering humanitarian aid to Yemen, negotiating freight with international shipping companies, and paying part of increased insurance expenses,‚Äù GTRI said.
India, heavily reliant on the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait for crude oil and LNG imports and trade with key regions, faces substantial economic and security risks from any disruption in this area, the think tank said, stating that approximately 65 per cent of India‚Äôs crude oil imports in FY 2022-23, valued at $105 billion, from countries like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and others, likely passed through the Suez Canal.

‚ÄúFor overall merchandise trade with Europe and North Africa, about 50 per cent of imports and 60 per cent of exports, totaling $113 billion, might have used this route. The conflict has necessitated India to consider alternative routes, such as going around Arica via the Cape of Good Hope, which could lead to increased energy costs. India might look to diversify its sources of crude oil and LNG, and explore alternative trade routes to reduce dependency on the conflict-prone Red Sea passage,‚Äù the report said.
This conflict is leading to increased shipping costs (40-60 per cent) and delays due to rerouting (upto 20 days more) , higher insurance premiums(15-20 per cent), and potential cargo loss from piracy and attacks, it added.

Sneh Rana jumps to career-best sixth in ICC T20I bowlers‚Äô ranking,"Off-spinner Rana advanced four places after taking two for 21 in the Tri-Series final against South Africa, which also featured the West Indies.","India‚Äôs Sneh Rana jumped four spots to a career-best sixth place while compatriot Deepti Sharma slipped a place down to third among bowlers in the latest ICC Women‚Äôs T20I Player Rankings issued on Tuesday.
Off-spinner Rana advanced four places after taking two for 21 in the Tri-Series final against South Africa, which also featured the West Indies.
South Africa left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba dislodged Deepti from the earlier second position after a fine performance against India in the final of the Tri-series.
Mlaba grabbed two for 16 in the final in East London to finish with six wickets in the Tri-Series which came at just 8.66 runs apiece and she conceded just 3.25 runs per over to move to a career-best 753 rating points, just 10 points behind England‚Äôs Sophie Ecclestone, another left-arm spinner.
Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (up one place to 10th), Deepti Sharma (up two places to 23rd) and Harleen Deol (up 20 places to 110th) are among those to move up the list for batters in the last update to the rankings ahead of the Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup beginning on Friday.
South Africa all-rounder Chloe Tryon is the main mover with the bat, following her unbeaten 57 in the final, which also won her the Player of the Match award.
The upcoming 10-team tournament in South Africa could see several possibilities as the best in the world compete across three venues in South Africa.

Australia batters Tahlia McGrath and Beth Mooney are looking at potential milestones. McGrath could achieve the highest points tally by a batter in the women‚Äôs T20I batting rankings as she is just 40 adrift of Charlotte Edwards‚Äôs record of 843 achieved in June 2009.
Mooney could become only the second Australian to reach 800 batting rating points after McGrath.

"Tata seeks control of Haldiram‚Äôs, snack maker wants $10 billion valuation","Haldiram's, a household name in India, is also talking with private equity firms including Bain Capital about the sale of a 10% stake, two people briefed on the matter said.","Tata Group‚Äôs consumer unit is in talks to buy at least 51% of popular Indian snack food maker Haldiram‚Äôs but is not comfortable with the $10 billion valuation sought, two people briefed on the matter said.
If successfully concluded, a deal would see the Indian conglomerate directly compete with Pepsi and billionaire Mukesh Ambani‚Äôs Reliance Retail.
Haldiram‚Äôs, a household name in India, is also talking with private equity firms including Bain Capital about the sale of a 10% stake, they said.

Tata Consumer Products, which owns UK tea company Tetley and has a partnership with Starbucks in India, has baulked at the $10 billion valuation given that Haldiram‚Äôs annual revenue is around $1.5 billion, the sources said.
Tata Consumer shares surged and closed nearly 4% higher in Mumbai trade after Reuters reported news of the talks.

A third person with direct knowledge of the discussions said Tata wants to buy more than 51% but has told Haldiram‚Äôs that its ‚Äúask is very high.‚Äù
The potential acquisition represents an exciting opportunity for Tata, the person said, adding: ‚ÄúTata (Consumer) is seen as a tea company. Haldiram‚Äôs is huge in the consumer space and has a wide market share.‚Äù
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.

A spokesperson for Tata Consumer Products said it ‚Äúdoes not comment on market speculation‚Äù. Haldiram‚Äôs Chief Executive Krishan Kumar Chutani and Bain declined to comment.
Family-run Haldiram‚Äôs traces its origins back to a tiny shop founded in 1937 and is well-known for its crispy ‚Äúbhujia‚Äù snack sold for as little as 10 rupees across mom-and-pop stores.
It has almost 13% share of India‚Äôs $6.2 billion savoury snack market, according to Euromonitor International. Pepsi, famous for its Lay‚Äôs chips, also has around 13%.

Haldiram‚Äôs snacks are also sold in overseas markets like Singapore and the United States. The company has around 150 restaurants selling local food, sweets and western cuisine.
Purchasing Haldiram‚Äôs would significantly expand Tata‚Äôs consumer products reach.
‚ÄúIf you want to suddenly grow big in size, no one better to provide access than Haldiram‚Äôs. No other brand attacks packaged food, and food services, with equal panache,‚Äù said Ankur Bisen, head of consumer and retail at Indian consultancy Technopak.
Tata‚Äôs consumer unit, which also sells salt, pulses and mineral water, had revenue of $1.7 billion in the past financial year. It is a relatively small part of the Tata Group, whose businesses span autos, aviation and hotels and which had combined revenue last year of some $144 billion.
Haldiram‚Äôs Chairman Manohar Lal Agrawal last year told CNBC TV18 in an interview the company wanted to attract private equity investors and debut on the stock market in 2-3 years.

Haldiram‚Äôs ‚Äì which has multiple registered companies in the country ‚Äì had revenue of at least $981 million in the financial year ended March 2022, according to regulatory filings. The first two sources, however, said its revenue is now close to $1.5 billion and annual operating profit is around $200 million.
The $10 billion valuation sought by Haldiram‚Äôs for the deal translates to 6.6 times its annual revenue of $1.5 billion, sources said.

Carey reminds Australia of Indian pacers‚Äô reverse-swing threat,"Australia abandoned the idea of ""irrelevant"" tour games in India and instead trained with SG balls on specially-prepared spinning pitches in Sydney before coming to India.","Australia wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey has reminded his team how damaging the Indian pacers could be with their reverse swing even as countering the threat from hosts spinners was the main focus in the build-up to their high profile four-match Test series starting on Thursday.
Australia abandoned the idea of ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù tour games in India and instead trained with SG balls on specially-prepared spinning pitches in Sydney before coming to India.
‚ÄúGoing to Pakistan it was a lot of spin talk and I found the reverse swinging ball difficult,‚Äù Carey told reporters here on the sidelines of their four-day training camp.
He recalled their tour game in Bengaluru in 2018 when pacers were equally making impact as the spinners and Mohammed Siraj returned with a match haul of 11 wickets.
‚ÄúI played a four-day game (for Australia A against India A) in 2018 and a lot of the talk was about spin and probably forget a bit how damaging both team‚Äôs fast bowlers are with the reverse-swinging ball, with a wicket that might be a bit up and down,‚Äù said the 31-year-old.
Carey also recalled their drawn Test series in Sri Lanka in July last year where the Australians had to adapt to different pitch conditions.
‚ÄúWe went to Galle for two Tests and they were two different wickets. So be open-minded about what we are going to come up against, what team they put on the park and what scenario I come in at,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúHaving the game ebb and flow between spin and fast bowling, dry periods, periods where it will score quickly‚Ä¶think that‚Äôs great about this team, the experience we do have.‚Äù Carey said the visiting team understands the capability of the Indian side, and will plan accordingly.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll speak to the guys who have played (in India) in the past and we‚Äôll have our batters‚Äô meeting soon. We‚Äôll face a lot of different spinners throughout the next few days, our spinners (are) bowling well as well, so for everyone it‚Äôs getting our feet on the ground.
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt really spoken about the way we are going to play, it‚Äôs the individual basis. For Travis it might be exploring that (attacking) game a bit, Renners (Matthew Renshaw) is a bit taller and can get to the pitch of the ball ‚Äî he has been here and succeeded ‚Äî so it‚Äôs up to the individual to own their game then we back them in to do that.‚Äù Known for his attacking instinct against the spinners, Carey said: ‚ÄúI like to sweep in most circumstances, most formats, then (it‚Äôs) playing the conditions.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an exciting Test tour, there will be chaos at times, wickets will fall at times, just try to manage those situations. When we are on top hopefully the batters can really go big,‚Äù said Carey who has not played Test cricket in India.
Since their defeat against England in 2012, India are on an enviable record streak of winning 15 consecutive Test series at home. No other team has won more than 10 home series in a row.

Design and display
The vanilla models in the Galaxy S24 series as well as the iPhone 15 series feature a flat display with an aluminium frame, which is pretty much in line with their predecessors. However, they differ significantly when it comes to design. On the front, you get a punch-hole display on the Galaxy S24 while the iPhone 15 borrows the Dynamic Island from the iPhone 14 Pro series.

The deal, which will see Zhao personally pay $50 million, was described by prosecutors as one of the largest corporate penalties in US history. It is another blow to the crypto industry that has been beset by investigations and comes on the heels of the recent fraud conviction of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
But several legal experts said it was a good outcome for Zhao, leaving his vast wealth intact and allowing him to retain his stake in Binance, the exchange he founded in 2017.

Binance broke US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with organizations the US described as terrorist groups including Hamas, al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, authorities said.
The exchange also never reported transactions with websites devoted to selling child sexual abuse materials and was one of the largest recipients of ransomware proceeds, they said.
‚ÄúBinance made it easy for criminals to move their stolen funds and illicit proceeds on its exchanges,‚Äù US Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Tuesday. ‚ÄúBinance also did more than just fail to comply with federal law. It pretended to comply.‚Äù
Some of the charges, which are both criminal and civil, relate to practices that Reuters reported first in a series of articles in 2022.
The Justice Department, which negotiated the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Treasury Department, is seeking an 18-month prison sentence for Zhao, the maximum suggested under federal guidelines, the New York Times reported.

Binance‚Äôs former chief compliance officer Samuel Lim was charged by the CFTC, the agency said. Neither Lim nor his lawyers responded to requests for comment.
Binance will pay $1.81 billion within 15 months, and a further $2.51 billion forfeiture as part of the deal, prosecutors said.
Zhao, a billionaire, was born in China and moved to Canada at the age of 12. He pleaded guilty in a Seattle court on Tuesday afternoon.

‚ÄúToday, I stepped down as CEO of Binance,‚Äù Zhao said on social media after the settlement was announced. ‚ÄúAdmittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.‚Äù
While authorities have probed Zhao and Binance for years, Zhao‚Äôs exit marks a dramatic development for one of the most powerful figures in the crypto industry, and for Binance. The deal raises questions over the future of the crypto exchange, which he has tightly controlled.
Richard Teng, a longtime Binance executive, will take over at Binance, Zhao said in his post.
‚ÄúThese resolutions acknowledge our company‚Äôs responsibility for historical, criminal compliance violations, and allow our company to turn the page,‚Äù Binance said in a statement.
In a separate statement, Teng said that his focus would be on ‚Äúreassuring users that they can remain confident in the financial strength, security and safety of the company.‚Äù

Zhao retains Binance stake
Vanderbilt University law professor Yesha Yadav said while the fine was extremely large it appeared manageable for Binance.
‚ÄúThis deal‚Ä¶looks designed to give Binance the chance to live another day, while removing CZ, a figurehead who has been so intrinsically linked to the growth of a business model,‚Äù she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Since Zhao appears to be retaining his stake in Binance, however, it‚Äôs possible he may still be able to exert influence on the company, Yadav added.
Zhao is worth $10.2 billion, according to Forbes.
Given the seriousness of the violations and actors involved, Zhao appears to have ‚Äúcome out of this looking pretty good‚Äù as the US government likely had to entice him to come to the US, said Robert Frenchman of Mukasey Frenchman LLP.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúHe still has enormous wealth,‚Äù Frenchman said. ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt likely to spend too much time in a US jail. He retains his ownership stake in Binance, a company that has now resolved some of its biggest legal issues.‚Äù
Prosecutors likely weighed those benefits for Zhao against the possibility that he may not have otherwise surrendered and the desire to convince Binance to agree to pay a hefty sum, said Jeffrey Cohen, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School and former federal prosecutor.
‚ÄúIf you can get a good number for a corporate fine and the cost is that the individual defendants take a slightly lesser penalty, the government makes that calculation,‚Äù Cohen said.
‚ÄòPotentially illegal‚Äô
Binance has been under the Justice Department‚Äôs scrutiny since at least 2018, Reuters reported last year, just one of a string of legal headaches it faces in the United States.
Federal prosecutors asked the company in December 2020 to provide internal records about its anti-money laundering efforts, along with communications involving Zhao.
The CFTC filed its civil charges against Binance in March, alleging it failed to implement an effective anti-money laundering program to detect and prevent terrorist financing. Internally, Binance officers and employees acknowledged that the platform facilitated ‚Äúpotentially illegal activities,‚Äù the CFTC alleged.
In February 2019, Binance‚Äôs Lim received information on transactions by the militant Palestinian group Hamas on Binance, the CFTC wrote.
Lim, a Singaporean, ‚Äúexplained to a colleague that terrorists usually send ‚Äòsmall sums‚Äô as ‚Äòlarge sums constitute money laundering‚Äô,‚Äù the CFTC said in its March lawsuit.
Daniel Silva, a partner at law firm Buchalter and former federal prosecutor said the allegations likely could have supported charges against Zhao carrying stiffer penalties like fraud or money laundering.
‚ÄúHe was at risk of much more serious charges, and so this resolution is a very favorable one for him,‚Äù Silva said.
Even so, a guilty plea involving the CEO of a company is rare and underscores the Justice Department‚Äôs push under Democratic leadership for charges against executives.
‚ÄúThe government is beating a drum on the issue of individual accountability,‚Äù said Kit Addleman, a partner with Haynes Boone law firm in Dallas.
She noted the size of the fines make clear the US government wants to rein in the crypto sector, describing the financial size of the deal as ‚Äústaggering‚Äù.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/binance-changpeng-zhao-pleads-guilty-steps-down-us-illicit-finance-probe-9037957/,business

Tata Electronics, a part of the Indian conglomerate, committed to invest 120.8 billion rupees for mobile phone assembly operations, the state government said during the signing of the agreements.

Simon Katich says unfair to blame David Warner entirely for ‚ÄòSandpaper-gate‚Äô scandal,Katich feels it would be difficult for most of the Australian public to forgive David Warner for his role in the sandpaper-gate scandal.,"Former Australia cricketer Simon Katich says he understands why it is difficult for most of the Australian public to forgive David Warner for his role in the sandpaper-gate scandal but feels it is unfair to blame the opener entirely.
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs hard to say ‚Äòfull respect‚Äô because I think there is always going to be an element of the public that didn‚Äôt like what happened, and rightfully so,‚Äù Katich told SEN Sportsday NSW.
Warner was adjudged to have played the leading role in the scandal and was banned from elite cricket for a year and from leadership positions for life. Steve Smith was also banned for a year and from leadership positions for three years, while opener Cameron Bancroft was given a one-year ban from leadership positions on top of a nine-month playing suspension.
‚ÄúA lot of us couldn‚Äôt believe what the Australian team resorted to,‚Äù said Katich.
‚ÄúBut I think to blame him entirely for that whole episode is pretty naive.‚Äù

At the same time Katich is impressed with how Warner has git himself back to playing cricket at such a high level despite receiving so much backlash.
‚ÄúI think in time, I‚Äôve got no doubt there will be more said about it,‚Äù Katich said.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúHe took the wrap along with Cameron Bancroft and Steve Smith but I think, the public feel there was more to it than just those three.
‚ÄúAt the time, I think what he did was he kept his mouth shut after the initial apology and then got on with trying to go back out there and try to play as good as cricket as he possibly could. That wouldn‚Äôt have been easy to do.
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs done is done but for David to be able to get back to where he got to after such an enormous event like it was in Cape Town‚Ä¶ it was significant to think that he was able to get back and play good cricket after that event.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/simon-katich-says-unfair-to-blame-david-warner-entirely-for-sandpaper-gate-scandal-9092793/,sports

James Webb Space Telescope takes stunning image of stars being born,"The James Webb Space Telescope captured this stunning image of a ""star-forming factory"" in deep space.","The James Webb Space Telescope took this stunning image of a star-forming nebula called N79, which is a region of ionised interstellar atomic hydrogen. The nebula is in the H II region of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and was captured by Webb‚Äôs Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).
N79 is simply a humongous star-forming celestial region that spans around 1,630 light-years and is in the southwest region of LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). It is regarded as the younger version of the Tarantula Nebula (officially known as 30 Doradus). However, scientists estimate that N79 has a star formation efficiency that far exceeds the Tarantula Nebula.
This image, in particular, focuses on one of three giant molecular clouds complex called N79 South or S1. The star-shaped pattern that you can see here is a series of diffraction spikes. Just like most other telescopes, Webb uses a mirror to collect light. The design of the mirror on the telescope causes this artifact.
The six largest ‚Äústar spikes‚Äù that you can see in the image are caused by the hexagonal symmetry of the Webb telescope‚Äôs 18 primary mirror segments. These sorts of patterns are usually most visible around very bright and compact objects where a lot of light comes from the same place. Even though most galaxies appear very small to our eyes, they are much more spread out than a single star and thus do not cause this pattern.
This particular image centres on one of the three giant molecular cloud complexes, dubbed N79 South (S1 for short). The distinct ‚Äòstarburst‚Äô pattern surrounding this bright object is a series of diffraction spikes. All telescopes that use a mirror to collect light, as Webb does, have this form of artifact that arises from the design of the telescope. In Webb‚Äôs case, the six largest starburst spikes appear because of the hexagonal symmetry of Webb‚Äôs 18 primary mirror segments. Patterns like these are only noticeable around very bright, compact objects, where all the light comes from the same place. Most galaxies, even though they appear very small to our eyes, are darker and more spread out than a single star, and therefore do not show this pattern.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/james-webb-space-telescope-n79-9128830/,technology
About 5 tonne tomatoes imported from Nepal in transit; to be sold in UP tomorrow at subsidised rate: NCCF,"In Uttar Pradesh, both imported and locally-procured tomatoes are being sold through static outlets as well as mobile vans at select locations.","Cooperative NCCF on Wednesday said about 5 tonne tomatoes imported from neighbouring country Nepal are in transit and will be retailed at a subsidised rate of Rs 50/kilogram in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.
The National Cooperative Consumers‚Äô Federation of India Ltd (NCCF) has contracted for import of 10 tonne of tomatoes from Nepal.
NCCF is undertaking imports as well as domestic procurement of tomatoes on behalf of the central government and retailing them at a subsidised rate to give relief to consumers from high prices of the kitchen staple.

The retail intervention is being undertaken on direction from the Union consumer affairs ministry.
Speaking to PTI, NCCF Managing Director Anice Joseph Chandra said, ‚ÄúWe have contracted 10 tonne of tomato imports from Nepal. Out of this, 3-4 tonne was distributed yesterday in Uttar Pradesh. About 5 tonne‚Ä¶is in transit and will be retailed tomorrow in UP at subsidised rates.‚Äù The imported tomatoes cannot be sold in other parts of India because of the short shelf life, she said.
In Uttar Pradesh, both imported and locally-procured tomatoes are being sold through static outlets as well as mobile vans at select locations.
In Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan, tomatoes procured from key producing states in the country are being sold at a subsidised rate of Rs 50 per kg, she added.

Asked about further import of tomatoes from Nepal, Joseph Chandra said, ‚ÄúThe imports will be undertaken from Nepal in a calibrated manner as domestic arrivals have started hitting to mandis in some states.‚Äù Arrival of the new tomato crop in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh has started in wholesale mandis and prices are also cooling down, she said.
As per the government data, all-India average wholesale price of tomatoes came down to Rs 88.22 per kg on August 15, when compared with Rs 97.56 per kg a month ago.

"Katrina Kaif went through ‚Äòtorture process‚Äô doing Tamil version of Merry Christmas, told Sriram Raghavan to ‚Äòtake another girl‚Äô instead","Merry Christmas director Sriram Raghavan admitted that it took some convincing to get Katrina Kaif to do the Tamil version of the film, but costs were escalating, and this was a good way to generate more revenue.","Director Sriram Raghavan opened up about the process of filming two versions of his upcoming thriller, Merry Christmas, back-to-back. Sriram first shot the film in Hindi, and then, mainly to mitigate escalating costs, shot a modified version in Tamil. He addressed the dryness that had set into the crew when they started work on the Tamil film, and said that the process was particularly ‚Äòtorturous‚Äô for Katrina Kaif, who even suggested that he cast a different actor in her place.
In an interview with Galatta Plus, Sriram said that they‚Äôd erected a set for the film, which went unused for several months because of scheduling conflicts. This escalated the film‚Äôs budget, which was a source of stress for the filmmaker, who‚Äôd envisioned it as a relatively small-scale project. ‚ÄúThe rewriting continued till the last day.

The movie also features Rashmika Mandanna, Bobby Deol, and Anil Kapoor in significant roles.

Rashmika recently took to social media to defend Animal and share insights about her character Gitanjali in the film. She wrote, ‚ÄúShe is pure, real, unfiltered, strong and raw.. At times as an actor, I would question some of Gitanjali‚Äôs actions.. And I remember my director telling me ‚Äì this was their story.. Ranvijay‚Äôs & Gitanjali‚Äôs.. it was their love and passion, their families and their lives ‚Äì this is who they are.‚Äù Animal has been facing a lot of criticism from critics and the audience for glorifying toxic masculinity and for being excessively violent and gory.

Under a Thousand: Majorly value for money for those seeking a fast charging power bank on a budget!,"Stuffcool, to its credit, has managed to add some style to the Major and it is easy to carry around (you can easily take it on a flight).","There was a time when a power bank with 10000 mAh capacity was considered massive, and would cost a pretty penny. Those days are fortunately behind us and today, it is not difficult to get a power bank with that capacity from a relatively known brand for under Rs 1000. However, with this capacity and lower price, there tend to come a few compromises ‚Äì the most notable of which are design and charging speed. Low-priced power banks from well-known brands tend to be clunky by design and/or charge at relatively slow speeds (generally around 10W).
The Major power bank from Stuffcool is a welcome change in this regard. The Major has two capacity variants ‚Äì 20000 mAh and 10000 mAh. The 20000 mAh one is priced at Rs 1499, while the 10000 mAh one comes for Rs 999. We have been using the 10000 mAh variant for a few days now and we have no hesitation in calling this perhaps the best power bank you can get for under a thousand Rupees in terms of balancing both capacity and charging speed.

"Retail inflation jumps to 4.81% in June, remains within RBI‚Äôs tolerance range","In March, Sebi barred 24 entities from the securities market based on prima facie findings, and now it has confirmed the ban against nine of them.","Sebi has refused to lift the securities market ban imposed on nine entities in a case concerning manipulating the share prices of Sharpline Broadcast Ltd through uploading misleading videos on YouTube channels.
The regulator, through an interim order in March, barred 24 entities from the securities market based on prima facie findings, and now it has confirmed the ban against nine of them.
‚ÄúThe prima facie findings in the interim order dated March 2, 2023, that the notices (nine entities) have prima facie engaged in a fraudulent and manipulative scheme resulting in prima facie contravention of provisions of the PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trading Practices) Regulations, stand confirmed,‚Äù Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in an order on Tuesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
The nine entities are Jatin Manubhai Shah, Angad M Rathod, Heli Jatin Shah, Daivik Jatin Shah, Ashok Kumar Agrawal, Anshu Aggarwal, Anshul Aggarwal, Hemant Dusad and Anshul Aggarwal Co HUF.
Of these, Sebi has given certain relaxations to four of them.
In its interim order, Sebi found that during the second half of May 2022, false and misleading YouTube videos about Sharpline Broadcast were uploaded on two YouTube channels ‚Äî Midcap Calls and Profit Yatra. These videos peddled false and misleading news to recommend that investors buy stocks of New Delhi-based Sharpline for extraordinary profits, Sebi said.
These YouTube channels had lakhs of subscribers and the videos had crores of viewership, aided by promotion through paid advertising campaigns.

Following the release of the videos on YouTube, there was an increase in prices and trading volume of the Sharpline scrip. The volumes appear to have been contributed by a large number of retail investors who might have been influenced by the misleading videos.
Sebi classified these entities into categories like creator of YouTube channels, net sellers and volume creators.
The entities orchestrated an egregious case of ‚Äúpump-and-dump‚Äù of Sharpline Broadcast, wherein they collectively helped create trading volumes and interest in the scrip, spread patently false and misleading YouTube videos about the scrip, and hence induced unsuspecting small investors to buy the scrip at elevated prices, Sebi added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/market/sharpline-stock-manipulation-sebi-refuses-lift-ban-misleading-youtube-videos-8830451/,business

Initially, both struggled with carrying buckets filled with bhujia and rasgulla, selling in the streets of old Delhi.
However, the Aggarwal brothers‚Äô hard work and the unique taste of Bikaner soon gained recognition and acceptance among the people of Delhi.

Bikaner Namkeen Bhandar soon became famous for its Moong Dal Halwa, Bikaneri Bhujia and Kaju Katli, amongst others. The two brothers and the shop soon became popular as Bikanervala.
‚ÄúAs we bid farewell to a legend, we carry forward his legacy with a deep sense of responsibility.

With the title race twisting and turning each week, Arsenal travelled north to Leicester fully anticipating a tough match against a side who thrashed Tottenham Hotspur 4-1 in their previous home match.
The hosts, without the influential James Maddison in midfield due to illness, never really got going, however, and failed to muster a shot on target in the match.
The visitors did not have to overly exert themselves to get the job done. Trossard was unlucky in the first half ‚Äî he will not hit many better strikes all season.
Martinelli‚Äôs finish was equally impressive on the run. No Arsenal player has more league goals than the Brazilian this season.

The result could have been more comfortable, with Arsenal having the ball in the net again only for it to be ruled out for offside, but they had no trouble seeing out the victory to keep them on course for a first league title in 19 years.
Arsenal have now won 10 of their 13 away league games this season, one more than in the whole of last term. It is the fastest they have reached 10 away wins in any league campaign.
Meanwhile, New Leeds United manager Javi Gracia‚Äôs reign began with a 1-0 Premier League home victory over bottom club Southampton as Junior Firpo‚Äôs goal helped the Yorkshire club to snap a 10-game winless run and move out of the relegation zone on Saturday.
Leeds jumped to 17th on 22 points after 24 games, a point above the drop zone, following a first league win since before the World Cup break.

The hosts dominated possession in Gracia‚Äôs first game since his appointment this week and edged a scrappy first half in which neither side created much of note.
Firpo finally broke the deadlock in front of a raucous Elland Road in the 77th minute, squeezing a tame effort under Gavin Bazunu after being cleverly set up with a flick by Jack Harrison.

Southampton piled on the pressure as they desperately searched for an equaliser, and dead-ball specialist James Ward-Prowse nearly created one as he whipped in a corner in 90th minute, but he was let down by a poor header from team mate Armel Bella-Kotchap.
Southampton, who will have thought their luck was turning after taking three points at Chelsea last week, remain 20th ‚Äî three points behind second-from-bottom Bournemouth, who host Manchester City later on Saturday.
While Aston Villa‚Äôs Ollie Watkins scored a penalty and Emiliano Buendia added a second goal as they beat Everton 2-0 in a frenetic Premier League encounter at Goodison Park on Saturday to leave the home side in the bottom three.

Despite dominating the game for long spells, Everton could not fashion a goal and are now 18th in the table on 21 points, above Bournemouth on goal difference, while Villa are 11th on 31 points.
The best chance of a high-energy first half fell to Everton, with Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez forced into a superb reflex save to deny Amadu Onana‚Äôs header in the 34th minute.
With Villa pinned back in their own half and struggling to pass the ball out from the back, Everton went even closer in the 54th minute as Tyrone Mings was forced to clear the ball off the line after a goal-mouth scramble.

Villa made a rare foray forward in the 59th minute and Watkins went close with a header but Jordan Pickford showed why Everton awarded him a new four-and-a-half-year contract this week by pulling off a superb save.
There was little he could do two minutes later when Villa were awarded a penalty in the 61st minute after John McGinn was upended in the box by Idrissa Gueye and referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot.
Watkins stepped up and smashed the spot kick down the middle and past Pickford to give his side a lead that was scarcely deserved.

Everton substitute Ellis Simms hooked a volley over the bar in the 77th minute but things went from bad to worse for the home side when they were punished by Buendia for committing too many players forward.
McGinn broke through the middle and angled a pass to Buendia who lashed a shot inside the near post in the 81st minute to double Villa‚Äôs advantage.
That took the wind out of the sails of the Toffees and Villa were able to contain them as they held on to secure all three points.
Watkins set a club record for Aston Villa by scoring for the fifth Premier League game in a row, and he was delighted with how his side weathered the storm and set him up to succeed from the spot.

Life in a Foreign University: How I chose to study International Trade in South Korea‚Äôs Pusan National University,Delhi boy Arbaz Hussain got a fully funded scholarship to South Korea. He is currently pursuing MA in international trade from Pusan National University.,"(This letter is part of a series by The Indian Express where we bring to you the experiences of students at different foreign universities. From scholarships and loans to food and cultural experiences ‚Äî students tell us how life is different in those countries and things they are learning other than academics)
‚ÄîArbaz Hussain
When it comes to higher education abroad, South Korea is quite an offbeat destination. However, over the years, the number of students and youth going there is rising. When my friend‚Äôs sister went there to pursue higher education on a fully paid scholarship, I was intrigued to look for more courses there. I always dreamt to study abroad and was already researching for a good foreign university.
Study in South Korea through fully funded scholarships
To encourage foreign students, South Korea provides various scholarships. I applied for the Global Korea Scholarship. It did not have an application fee and once you get the scholarship, everything including the airfare to South Korea is paid by the government.
Also Read | Life in a Foreign University | ‚ÄòFrom a village to London School of Economics, how winning Chevening Scholarship opened opportunities for me‚Äô
Unlike many European countries where you have to get selected for a college in order to get a scholarship, here you can apply to both simultaneously. You can apply through two tracks ‚Äî the embassy track and the university track. I applied through the former and the application process was fairly easy. You have to fill out the application form and choose three universities (two in group A and one in group B) along with the course you want to apply for. I don‚Äôt know much about the application process through the university track.
The three universities I chose were ‚Äî Yonsei University (Type A), Seoul National University (Type A) and Pusan National University (Type B). The documents needed to apply for the universities and scholarship were Class 10 and 12 marksheet, university transcripts, two letters of recommendation (LoRs), study plan, Statement of Purpose, medical fitness and if you have extra certificates such as English and Korean languages proficiency then those as well.
Life in a Foreign University: Arbaz Hussain
Since I applied through the embassy track, I had to submit the documents to the Ministry of Education. Then it goes to the Embassy of Korea for scrutiny. Once it is done, they call you for the interview. In my panel, there were two Korean representatives and one MoE representative.
I got the scholarship as well as admission to Pusan National University. I started with International Studies as my major but did not find it very interesting so I later switched to International Trade, since I graduated with a BCom (Bachelors of Commerce) from Jamia Millia Islamia. Once I came to Korea, I had to study the Korean language for one year before beginning my course. I studied at Kangwon National University from March 2021 to February 2022. I know Korean till TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean) level 5, and the highest level is 6.
ADVERTISEMENT
I then joined my college in March 2022 and I will graduate in February 2024. My course is taught both in English and Korean, and we can opt for either language. As for future plans, I want to stay in Korea for some time after my PG and find a job here. While, I am open to working at other places as well, in the long run, I would like to return to India.
South Koreans‚Äì their lifestyle, food and culture
Busan and Seoul are the biggest cities in the country and are expensive as well. People here have good disposable money and the standard of living is high. South Korea is about to surpass Japan in terms of per capita income.
Though we are given a monthly allowance to bear our expenses, the government doesn‚Äôt provide us with accommodation. I live by myself in a one room kitchen apartment. Though a little expensive, it‚Äôs still spacious and comfortable.
Life in a Foreign University: Arbaz Hussain
I generally cook my own food. Additionally, there are Indian stores from where you can order. However, though I am a non-vegetarian it is not very difficult for me. The only dietary restriction I have is pork. But people who are vegetarian will find it very difficult to sustain themselves as the food is mainly non-vegetarian. The food here is a little more expensive than in India, for example, milk is around Rs 200 per litre while something like red masoor dal is around Rs 350 per kilo.
Friends in a foreign land
ADVERTISEMENT
I have made friends here and my closest friends include people from Italy, Cambodia, USA, France, Uzbekistan and Korea. There are two Indians in my class.
The teachers here in Korea are very polite and helpful at all times. They would never disrespect or scold a student, especially in front of anyone. They are very cautious about how they are dealing with a student. Sometimes, the language might act as a bit of a barrier as teachers can have a certain accent or their grammar might be a bit off the place but they try their best. The teaching process, however, is not completely different since it is Asian, it is about memorising.
Also Read | Life in a Foreign University: ‚ÄòWhy I chose studying Political Science in Paris over Indian varsities‚Äô
Whenever I feel homesick, I call up my parents or friends. If that doesn‚Äôt work, I go out with my friends here. I went home in January this year.
Travelling around South Korea
I often go out and explore the city and not just eat out or so, I go trekking, to beaches and more. Busan is quite a large city, in fact, the second largest city in South Korea. It is very beautiful and has a lot of things to explore ‚Äî from beaches to mountains, so I go out twice a month. Other than that, I go out of the city once every two months or so. I have been to Jeju Island, Gangneung and even Pyeongchang, where the 2018 Winter Olympics were held.

Life in a Foreign University: Arbaz Hussain
Research well before studying abroad
For students who want to study abroad, I would suggest they be clear with what they want to study, the course, the university and everything. They should sort out their finances and not fall prey to the agencies that claim to get them admission to foreign universities and if possible they should try for scholarships. For students wanting to study in Korea, please check the course and language requirements for it like in which language the classes will be held. The culture and food are different and if you have some specific dietary restrictions then it might be a problem, but overall it is a good experience.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-a-foreign-university-how-i-chose-to-study-in-south-koreas-pusan-national-university-study-abroad-8848576/,education

Scientists propose oxygen could hold the key to finding alien technology,Astronomers propose that oxygen levels of a planet can tell whether alien technology signatures (technosignatures) can be found there.,"The search for extraterrestrial or alien life continues stronger than ever and scientists are widening the search to look beyond biosignatures to see if they can find ‚Äútechnological signatures.‚Äù We already know the importance of oxygen for life as we know it, but two astronomers propose that it can also be the key to accessing advanced technology at a planetary scale.
The research paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy last month looked into what conditions on a planet can send out signals about the existence of intelligent life that can produce technology. They found that ‚Äúthe atmospheric requirements may be quite stringent,‚Äù according to co-author Amedeo Balbi, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy.
Oxygen: For breathing and burning
Apart from its importance in respiration and other life processes, oxygen is also a crucial ingredient in developing fire, the researchers propose. And fire is the hallmark of a civilisation that harnesses technology.
  Technology was developed on Earth thanks to the process of open-air combustion. This elementary process where something burns with fuel and oxygen is crucial for everything from producing tools to building shelter.
How much oxygen is too much?
Interestingly, the level of oxygen required to sustain complex biological life and even intelligence are not as high as the levels needed to develop technology, according to the researchers. This should mean that even if life were to emerge on a planet with oxygen, it might not be able to become a technological species.
‚ÄúYou might be able to get biology‚Äîyou might even be able to get intelligent creatures‚Äîin a world that doesn‚Äôt have oxygen but without a ready source of fire, you‚Äôre never going to develop higher technology because higher technology requires fuel and melting,‚Äù said coauthor Adam Frank, the Helen F. and Fred H. Gowen Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Rochester, in a press statement.
The researchers created the term ‚Äúoxygen bottleneck‚Äù to describe the threshold that separates planets capable of fostering technological civilisation from those that cannot. Essentially, oxygen levels act as a bottleneck that can stop an alien lifeform from developing technology.
ADVERTISEMENT
So what?
The study looks at a previously unexplored side of the pursuit of extraterrestrial life ‚Äî there could be a need to prioritise planets that have high oxygen levels when looking for techno-signatures. This could potentially help fine-tune the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/oxygen-alien-life-technology-planets-9096335/,technology

Tesla sued by US agency over alleged harassment of Black factory workers,"The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in California that from 2015 to the present, Black workers at the Tesla plant have routinely been subjected to racist slurs and graffiti, including swastikas and nooses.","A U.S. civil rights agency sued Tesla Inc on Thursday, claiming the electric carmaker has tolerated severe harassment of Black employees at its flagship Fremont, California, assembly plant, in charges similar to cases brought by the state and by Tesla employees.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in California that from 2015 to the present, Black workers at the Tesla plant have routinely been subjected to racist slurs and graffiti, including swastikas and nooses.
Tesla has failed to investigate complaints of racist conduct and has fired or otherwise retaliated against workers who reported harassment, the EEOC said in the lawsuit.
ADVERTISEMENT
The lawsuit adds federal charges to discrimination claims by the state of California and lawsuits by Tesla employees.
It follows the breakdown of settlement talks with the EEOC after Tesla announced that the agency had formally raised its concerns last year. The EEOC routinely settles lawsuits with employers, and it is relatively rare for the agency‚Äôs cases to go to trial.
Tesla faces several other race discrimination lawsuits that make similar claims, including a class action by workers at the Fremont plant and a lawsuit by a California civil rights agency. The company in those cases has said it does not tolerate discrimination and takes workers complaints seriously.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company‚Äôs stock price rose 2.4% on Thursday to $246.38.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúIf the federal government gets involved, it certainly adds credibility to the claims,‚Äù said Stephen Diamond, a law professor at Santa Clara University, who noted that he has advised investors on social responsibility at Tesla.
‚ÄúMajor institutional investors like pension funds will be very concerned about this type of behavior,‚Äù he said.
The EEOC in the lawsuit said it began investigating Tesla after the five-member commission‚Äôs chair, Charlotte Burrows, filed an internal complaint known as a charge against the company.
ADVERTISEMENT
After finding last year that there was ‚Äúreasonable cause‚Äù to believe Tesla had violated the federal law banning workplace race discrimination, the agency tried and failed to enter into a settlement agreement with the company, according to the lawsuit.
Burrows in a statement said that combating widespread workplace harassment is a key priority for the EEOC.
‚ÄúEvery employee deserves to have their civil rights respected, and no worker should endure the kind of shameful racial bigotry our investigation revealed,‚Äù she said.
The EEOC‚Äôs lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages for an unspecified number of Black workers, along with an order requiring Tesla to overhaul its policies prohibiting discrimination and retaliation.
Tesla is seeking to fend off similar claims from the California Civil Rights Department, a state-level counterpart of the EEOC. The department alleges that Tesla discriminated against Black workers when making decisions about pay, promotions and work assignments.
ADVERTISEMENT
The department‚Äôs lawsuit alleges violations of California law, while the EEOC case involves similar federal laws.
Tesla has claimed that the California department‚Äôs lawsuit was politically motivated and has argued that the agency violated state law by suing without first notifying the company of all of the claims or giving it a chance to settle.
ADVERTISEMENT
A California judge last year rejected Tesla‚Äôs motion to dismiss that case, and is now considering various issues related to pre-trial discovery.
In addition, a Black former elevator operator at the Fremont plant, Owen Diaz, is seeking a third trial in his 2017 lawsuit claiming he was subjected to severe racial harassment after a jury in April awarded him $3.2 million.
ADVERTISEMENT
A different jury in 2021 had awarded Diaz $137 million, but a federal judge said that was excessive and Diaz opted for a new trial instead of a reduced award of $15 million.
Tesla is also facing a class action lawsuit in California state court over the alleged mistreatment of Black factory workers.

Commenting on the newly introduced platform fee, Akshant said: ‚ÄúStarting Q2FY24, customers are being charged a nominal platform fee (in the range of Rs 2-5 per order) on every order, including those of Zomato Gold members. It is a small fee to make our economics better and viable in the long run. We make sure we keep our service affordable for our customers at all times‚Äù.
Blinkit Founder Albinder Dhindsa said on a YoY basis, the GOV growth (for Blinkit) was 86 per cent, as expected and in line with the past.
‚ÄúGOV growth was largely driven by same store sales growth as we continue to focus on serving more customer needs and ensuring consistency of service levels. We also saw a net addition of 28 new stores during the quarter, taking our overall store count to 411 stores at the end of the quarter,‚Äù he added.
Commenting on Blinkit, Akshant said: ‚ÄúWe have also seen festivals driving much stronger growth for quick commerce as compared to food delivery.

‚ÄúI am thankful to the viewers for staying through the entire premiere, as I might not have done the same. I came to IFFK with great expectations, but the projection quality was disappointingly poor and the sound quality was the worst I have ever encountered. It‚Äôs such a shame. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you provided me with accommodation at a big hotel. I am ready to sleep even on the floor. However, compromising on screening quality is unacceptable,‚Äù he said, addressing the viewers before storming out of the hall.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Chhatrapal Ninawe reiterated his dissatisfaction, stating, ‚ÄúI believe this theatre has an incredible legacy, and these issues are easily fixable. It‚Äôs unfortunate that they weren‚Äôt addressed. My sound designer (Manoj M Goswami) worked on the Baahubali movies, so you can imagine how meticulously we crafted Ghaath‚Äôs sound.

The model, with its ‚Äòsmall lots, frequent deliveries‚Äô concept, finally culminates on the assembly line, where each of these small parts are progressively integrated into the larger body frame or key components of the car, and has endured for the better part of the last half-a-century as an intrinsic part of the world‚Äôs largest carmaker‚Äôs much-vaunted Toyota Production System (TPS).

"Automated IGST refunds on pan masala, tobacco, similar items to be restricted from October 1","Exporters of such items will have to approach jurisdictional Tax officers with their refund claims and get them cleared, as per a notification dated July 31.","Automated refund of Integrated GST (IGST) on export of pan masala, tobacco, and similar other items will be restricted from October 1, the finance ministry has said.
Exporters of such items will have to approach jurisdictional Tax officers with their refund claims and get them cleared, as per a notification dated July 31.
The changes in the notification will come into effect from October 1.
ADVERTISEMENT
Tax experts said the move is aimed at checking tax evasion in the sector, as there might be over-valuation of goods which are being exported, thus leading to higher IGST refund outgo.
Manual checking of refunds will ensure that valuation is optimally done and taxes are paid at all stages.
The items on which automated IGST refund restriction has been imposed include pan masala, unmanufactured tobacco, hookah, gutkha, smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes and other items, including mentha oil. Such items attract 28 per cent IGST, plus a cess.
AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said such restriction on automated refunds for pan masala Tobacco & other similar items would lead to a blip in exporters‚Äô cash flow, reduce global competitiveness in the sector, and increase compliance and administrative burden on the exporters.
ADVERTISEMENT
Restricting IGST refunds may lead to a temporary increase in tax revenue for the government, as the refund amount will remain with the government for a more extended period.
‚ÄúIndia is one of the world‚Äôs major exporters of pan masala, primarily to countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and some African nations. Therefore, exporters of pan masala may see a constrained cash flow position in the last quarter of 2023, impacting normal course of business,‚Äù Mohan added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/automated-igst-refunds-pan-masala-tobacco-similar-items-restricted-from-october-1-8870899/,business
"Rafael Nadal could be out for 6-8 weeks, confirms grade 2 muscle tear in his left leg",The Spaniard was a set and break down during his second-round defeat to Mackenzie McDonald at the 2023 Australian Open when he crouched down in pain clutching his hip.,"Rafael Nadal may spend 6-8 weeks out of competitive action again, after suffering a Grade 2 tear in the iliopsoas muscle in his left leg.
Confirming the injury, Nadal took to Twitter on Thursday and wrote, ‚ÄúGood afternoon. I have carried out medical tests after the defeat yesterday. The MRI shows a grade 2 lesion in the Iliacus Psoas of his left leg. Now it‚Äôs sports rest and anti-inflammatory physiotherapy. Normal recovery time 6 to 8 weeks.‚Äù
The Spaniard was a set and break down during his second-round defeat to Mackenzie McDonald at the 2023 Australian Open when he crouched down in pain clutching his hip. A lengthy match timeout for treatment, and a laboured performance to get past the finish line, were both indicative that the injury he suffered was serious. In his post-match press conference he confirmed the pain was in his hip, but he was unsure of the extent of the injury.
Buenas tardes. He realizado pruebas m√©dicas tras la derrota en el d√≠a de ayer. La resonancia magn√©tica muestra una lesi√≥n grado 2 en el Psoas Iliaco de su pierna izquierda.

‚Äî Rafa Nadal (@RafaelNadal) January 19, 2023
Nadal, alongside his doctor Angel Ruiz Cotorro, stayed back in Melbourne to get medical tests that revealed it was not an impact injury or a joint issue, but actually, a muscle tear, for which rehabilitation and recovery tend to take a longer, more complicated time.
The Grade 2 tear comes in his in the iliopsoas muscle of his left leg, which joins the abdomen to the thigh. It is a flexor muscle for the hip, confirming Nadal‚Äôs suspicion during the match. The Spaniard felt his movement in his hip, especially during his backhand motion, was severely restricted ever since he went down in the second set.

Nayara Energy exports drop 22% as domestic consumption rises,"Nayara Energy, which operates a 20 million tonne a year oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat, exported 4.57 million tonne of petroleum products including jet fuel, gasoil (diesel) and gasoline (petrol) between January-September 2023.","Nayara Energy, India‚Äôs largest private fuel retailer, on Friday said its petroleum product exports dropped by 22 per cent in the first nine months of 2023 as domestic consumption rose.
Nayara, which operates a 20 million tonne a year oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat and a network of over 6,450 petrol pumps, exported 4.57 million tonne of petroleum products including jet fuel, gasoil (diesel) and gasoline (petrol) between January-September 2023 as compared to 5.88 million tonne in January-September 2022, the firm said in a statement.
This was primarily because of larger consumption at home. The company is catering to the domestic market through institutional business, sales to other oil companies and through its own retail chain.
ADVERTISEMENT
Natural exports markets are in the Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia ‚Äì the markets which have a consistent appetite for Nayara‚Äôs products throughout the year.
Commercially, it is unviable to cater to the seasonal requirements of EU markets (winter grade diesel). ‚ÄúNayara‚Äôs diesel does not meet the winter specification requirements of the EU market, we see no commercial opportunity in this market,‚Äù it said.
Domestic sales made up for 69 per cent of the volumes during January-September 2023 and exports the remaining 31 per cent.
Out of the total 4.57 million tonne exports, diesel shipments stood at about 2.44 million tonne which is roughly 53 per cent of all exports for the same period.

The company said geographical proximity governs its exports markets. ‚ÄúAfrica, Southeast Asia and the Middle East continue to remain the company‚Äôs primary export markets contributing to about 82 per cent of the total exports of petroleum products.‚Äù Between January-September 2023, Nayara supplied no gasoil and gasoline to Europe.
‚ÄúOur primary focus for gasoline remains ensuring consistent supply to domestic markets through our retail outlets, and oil companies,‚Äù Nayara said adding gasoline export sales were flat at 0.9 million tonne in January-September 2023 when compared with the year-ago period.
Gasoil percentage export sales in the European Union has been less than 3 per cent of total gasoil exports during the last 5 years, it said adding Nayara supplied no diesel to Europe this year.

Also, ‚Äúno gasoline has been exported to Europe,‚Äù it said.
The company is primarily focused on catering to the domestic market through institutional business, sales to other oil companies and through its own retail chain.
India structurally, is long on diesel and the surplus is to be exported after satisfying domestic demand.
Nayara is the fastest growing private retail network with the addition of around 500 retail outlets every year. Nayara network is fully automated (98 per cent of outlets) for enhanced controls and standards.
Prasad Panicker, Chairman and Head of Refinery, Nayara Energy, said, ‚ÄúAs an Indian company, Nayara is in India and for India. We are highly committed and driven to fuel the nation‚Äôs growing demand for energy. As a major downstream player, delivering about 8 per cent of India‚Äôs refining output, Nayara Energy is contributing significantly towards India‚Äôs energy security.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe believe in being a strong partner to India‚Äôs energy needs and will continue to serve the country‚Äôs consumption demands.

Kotak Mahindra Bank drops over 2% after naming new CEO,Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank fell more than 2% on Monday after it named veteran banker Ashok Vaswani as managing director and CEO following founder Uday Kotak's resignation.,"Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank fell more than 2% on Monday after it named veteran banker Ashok Vaswani as managing director and CEO following founder Uday Kotak‚Äôs resignation, raising fears of volatility in the Indian lender‚Äôs business going forward.
Shares fell as much as 2.7% to 1,722.45 rupees on Monday. The stock was last down 1.2% at 1,749 rupees.
The private lender said on Saturday that the central bank has approved the appointment of the veteran international banker Vaswani, surprising analysts who had expected an insider would succeed the founder for the top job.

The bank‚Äôs preference may have been for existing senior management, with KVS Manian and Shanti Ekambaram being top contenders for the CEO‚Äôs role, Jefferies‚Äô analysts said in a note.
Jefferies downgraded the stock to ‚Äúhold‚Äù from ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and cut the target price to 1,940 rupees apiece from 2,400 rupees earlier.
Emkay said that the new CEO would have ‚Äúa tall task‚Äù on his hands to manage senior management attrition or any ‚Äúbusiness dislocation.‚Äù
The brokerage maintained a ‚Äúhold‚Äù rating on the stock and cut the target price to 1,955 rupees per share from 2,000 rupees earlier.

Moreover, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) caps the age of CEOs at 70, five years down the line, the bank would again be talking of leadership transition issues, assuming Vaswani serves two full three-year terms, Macquarie analyst Suresh Ganapathy said in a note.

Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan released the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, which will replace the 2019 guidelines.
According to Pradhan, the new rules are built on the principle of a ‚Äúlight but tight‚Äù regulatory framework envisioned in the National Education Policy 2020.
‚ÄúThe new simplified guidelines will encourage universities to focus on quality and excellence, strengthen the research ecosystem and have a long-term impact in transforming our higher education landscape. The norms will facilitate creation of many more quality-focused deemed to be universities in an objective and transparent manner,‚Äù Pradhan said.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) Act provides for the central government to declare any institution other than a university the status of institution deemed to be university. The first set of regulations in this regard was notified in 2010 and these were subsequently revised in 2016 and 2019.
Under the 2019 guidelines, the higher education institutions having ‚Äúexistence for not less than 20 years‚Äù were eligible for applying for the status. However, the revised guidelines have now replaced it with multi-disciplinarity, NAAC grading, NIRF ranking and NBA grading.
ADVERTISEMENT
It means any multi-disciplinary institution having valid accreditation by NAAC with at least 3.01 cumulative grade point average (CGPA) for three consecutive cycles, NBA accreditation for two-thirds of eligible programmes for three consecutive cycles or in the top 50 of any specific category of NIRF for the last three years continuously will be able to apply for the deemed status, the guidelines stated.

Besides, a cluster of institutions managed by more than one sponsoring body or a society can also apply for deemed to be university status, it added.
The new regulations also introduces the ‚ÄúDistinct Institution‚Äù category, where an existing institution or an institution starting from the beginning with the focus on teaching and research in unique disciplines and/or addressing the strategic needs of the country or engaged in the preservation of Indian cultural heritage or preservation of the environment or dedicated to skill development or dedicated to sports or languages or any other discipline, so determined by the Expert Committee of Commission, will be exempted from eligibility criteria.
UGC chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar said that the 2023 guidelines are in tune with NEP 2020 and they are light but tight.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe hope these regulations will encourage many more high-quality higher education institutions to be established in our country in emerging areas to meet the aspirations of our students. Since ‚Äòdeemed to be universities‚Äô wording is part of the UGC Act, 1956, we cannot remove this term at this time. However, it will be removed once the Higher Education Commission of India is established through an act of Parliament,‚Äù he said.
There are around 170 deemed institutions in the country currently.
Among other criteria that have been changed are the faculty strength has been increased from 100 to 150, corpus fund for private institutions has been increased from Rs 10 crore to Rs 25 crore, and creation of an executive councils like central universities in these universities as well.
The revised guidelines have also made it mandatory for deemed universities to register on Academic Bank of Credits (ABC). ‚ÄúThe institutions can offer twinning programmes, joint degree programmes, and dual degree programmes in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the regulations concerned,‚Äù the guidelines stated.
Besides, deemed universities with minimum ‚ÄòA‚Äô grade and above or ranked from 1 to 100 in the ‚Äúuniversities‚Äù category of NIRF rankings of the relevant year are eligible to set up off-campus centres.

Pankaj Tripathi says Main Atal Hoon makers ensured film on former PM doesn‚Äôt end up as propaganda: ‚ÄòWe were conscious about it‚Äô,"Pankaj Tripathi said his upcoming release, Main Atal Hoon, on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is made in a sensible and engaging manner.","Pankaj Tripathi says many people come up to him for selfies and sometimes they have not even seen any of his work but they know about his performance through memes and reels that keep trending on social media.
The actor, whose Kaleen Bhaiya‚Äôs character from the Prime Video series Mirzapur first became a viral meme, credits the public for making him into a popular face.
‚ÄúI just say what I feel like. I‚Äôm glad people connect to it. Janta (public) has made me popular with memes and reels. I‚Äôm the hero of the audience, they made me a popular actor. I don‚Äôt know marketing and all. Earlier, I would turn up for interviews and events dressed casually, but now I dress up,‚Äù Tripathi told PTI.

Tripathi, who hails from Belsand village in Gopalganj district of Bihar, narrated an incident from his birthplace to reiterate his social media popularity and how it sometimes has nothing to do with his movies.
‚ÄúRecently, I came across two boys in my village. They came to me and said they wanted a picture with me. I was like, ‚ÄòWhich film or show of mine have you seen?‚Äô They said, ‚ÄòWe haven‚Äôt seen any of them but we have seen your memes‚Äô. They were like, ‚ÄòWe are just happy to see you‚Äô,‚Äù he recalled.
The actor, who will next be seen in a biopic on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, understands commercial cinema‚Äôs ability to reach a wide audience. His own taste in cinema may veer towards the middle-of-the-road and independent projects but he always tries to strike a balance when it comes to his roles, he said.

Tripathi said he is an admirer of films such as Court, Killa, Trance and Mandela but commercial cinema, with its power to reach more people, can also impart a message.
‚ÄúMy sense of cinema is that it should be sensible yet commercial, and have a wide reach. We make films with the intention to reach out to more people. Like, ‚ÄòOh My God 2‚Äô is sensible cinema. It was such a solid subject about sex education and it did well at the box office and on OTT,‚Äù Tripathi said.
‚ÄúWe often learn a lot of things when said in a light-hearted manner. While, the moment we become serious, we might lose interest. But as an audience my interest is in independent cinema,‚Äù he added.
Tripathi said his upcoming release, Main Atal Hoon, on former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is made in a sensible and engaging manner.

The biographical drama is directed by filmmaker Ravi Jadhav of Natarang and Balgandharva fame.
‚ÄúThis is the story of Atal ji‚Äôs life and also of India‚Äôs journey from the time of independence, how elections would happen, how voting would happen, how society changed. The purpose of the biopic is to provide entertainment and at the same time it serves as an inspiration,‚Äù the actor said.
The actor further said when he first arrived on the Main Atal Hoon set, he didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúconfident‚Äù.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm never confident on the first day of shoot irrespective of the role, whether it is fictional or non-fictional. I‚Äôm always like, ‚ÄòWhat will I do? How will I do it? For two-three days, I‚Äôve been struggling to find the sur of the character.

I was sure I didn‚Äôt want to imitate Atal ji or get close to him in terms of his look with the help of prosthetics, I had to capture his soul.‚Äù In response to a question about how the team ensured the movie would not end up as propaganda, Tripathi said they had made every effort to be authentic.
‚ÄúWe were aware and conscious about it but our whole purpose was to bring out the persona of Atal ji on the big screen. Since the film is a biopic, we had to make sure that we got things factually correct,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI feel one should present the person on screen in the most honest possible way. We are humans, we have both goodness and shortcomings and that‚Äôs how it should be presented on screen,‚Äù he added.

Apple files appeal after Biden administration allows US ban on watch imports,The U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) order bars imports and sales of Apple Watches that use technology for reading blood-oxygen levels.,"Apple on Tuesday appealed a decision to ban imports of its watches based on a complaint from medical monitoring technology company Masimo, after U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs administration declined to veto a government tribunal.
The tech giant also filed an emergency request on Tuesday for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban.
It asked the Federal Circuit to pause the ban at least until U.S. Customs and Border Protection decides whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo‚Äôs patents, and to put the ban on hold while the court considers Apple‚Äôs request. The customs office is due to make its decision on Jan. 12, Apple said.

Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into the popular Apple Watch.

The U.S. International Trade Commission‚Äôs (ITC) order bars imports and sales of Apple Watches that use technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included the pulse oximeter feature in its smart watches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai decided not to reverse the ban following careful consultations, and the ITC‚Äôs decision became final on Dec. 26, the Trade Representative‚Äôs office said on Tuesday.
An Apple spokesperson said the company has appealed the ban to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible,‚Äù Apple said in a statement on Tuesday.
The ITC last week rejected Apple‚Äôs request to pause the ban during the appeal process and opposed Apple‚Äôs request for the Federal Circuit to halt the ban in a court filing on Tuesday.
A Masimo spokesperson called the ITC decision ‚Äúa win for the integrity of the U.S. patent system, and ultimately American consumers.‚Äù
While companies usually settle such disputes, Apple may think it can design around the patents quickly or remove the infringing feature, said Nicholas Matich, an intellectual property attorney with law firm McKool Smith.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing legally extraordinary about the ITC issuing an exclusion order,‚Äù Matich said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs extraordinary here is that the product at issue is high profile and that Apple has chosen to live with the ITC order rather than settle.‚Äù
Stifel analysts said in a note that their litigation expert predicted a potential Apple appeal would extend the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù ITC case verdict roughly another year.
Apple has paused its sales of its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the United States since last week, though the watches remain available from other retailers including Amazon , Best Buy and Walmart as of Tuesday.
The ban does not affect Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model, which will continue to be sold. Previously sold watches will not be affected by the ban.

A jury trial on Masimo‚Äôs allegations in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware and has called Masimo‚Äôs legal actions a ‚Äúmaneuver to clear a path‚Äù for its own competing smart watch.
A presidential administration has not vetoed an ITC ruling since 2013, when President Barack Obama‚Äôs administration overturned an import ban on Apple‚Äôs iPhones and iPads in the company‚Äôs patent dispute with Samsung.
The Biden administration in February chose not to veto a separate import ban on Apple Watches based on a patent-infringement complaint from medical technology company AliveCor. The ITC has placed the ban on hold for other reasons.

OpenAI researchers warned board of AI breakthrough ahead of CEO ouster: Report,Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup's search for what's known as artificial general intelligence (AGI).,"Ahead of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äôs four days in exile, several staff researchers wrote a letter to the board of directors warning of a powerful artificial intelligence discovery that they said could threaten humanity, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The previously unreported letter and AI algorithm were key developments before the board‚Äôs ouster of Altman, the poster child of generative AI, the two sources said. Prior to his triumphant return late Tuesday, more than 700 employees had threatened to quit and join backer Microsoft in solidarity with their fired leader. The sources cited the letter as one factor among a longer list of grievances by the board leading to Altman‚Äôs firing, among which were concerns over commercializing advances before understanding the consequences. Reuters was unable to review a copy of the letter. The staff who wrote the letter did not respond to requests for comment.
After being contacted by Reuters, OpenAI, which declined to comment, acknowledged in an internal message to staffers a project called Q* and a letter to the board before the weekend‚Äôs events, one of the people said. An OpenAI spokesperson said that the message, sent by long-time executive Mira Murati, alerted staff to certain media stories without commenting on their accuracy.

Some at OpenAI believe Q* (pronounced Q-Star) could be a breakthrough in the startup‚Äôs search for what‚Äôs known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), one of the people told Reuters. OpenAI defines AGI as autonomous systems that surpass humans in most economically valuable tasks.
Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems, the person said on condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak on behalf of the company. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*‚Äôs future success, the source said. Reuters could not independently verify the capabilities of Q* claimed by the researchers.
VEIL OF IGNORANCE
Researchers consider math to be a frontier of generative AI development. Currently, generative AI is good at writing and language translation by statistically predicting the next word, and answers to the same question can vary widely. But conquering the ability to do math ‚Äî where there is only one right answer ‚Äî implies AI would have greater reasoning capabilities resembling human intelligence. This could be applied to novel scientific research, for instance, AI researchers believe.
Unlike a calculator that can solve a limited number of operations, AGI can generalize, learn and comprehend. In their letter to the board, researchers flagged AI‚Äôs prowess and potential danger, the sources said without specifying the exact safety concerns noted in the letter. There has long been discussion among computer scientists about the danger posed by highly intelligent machines, for instance if they might decide that the destruction of humanity was in their interest.

Researchers have also flagged work by an ‚ÄúAI scientist‚Äù team, the existence of which multiple sources confirmed. The group, formed by combining earlier ‚ÄúCode Gen‚Äù and ‚ÄúMath Gen‚Äù teams, was exploring how to optimize existing AI models to improve their reasoning and eventually perform scientific work, one of the people said.
Altman led efforts to make ChatGPT one of the fastest growing software applications in history and drew investment ‚Äì and computing resources ‚Äì necessary from Microsoft to get closer to AGI.
In addition to announcing a slew of new tools in a demonstration this month, Altman last week teased at a summit of world leaders in San Francisco that he believed major advances were in sight.
‚ÄúFour times now in the history of OpenAI, the most recent time was just in the last couple weeks, I‚Äôve gotten to be in the room, when we sort of push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward, and getting to do that is the professional honor of a lifetime,‚Äù he said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.

Microsoft overtakes Apple as world‚Äôs most valuable company,Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company on Thursday after the iPhone maker began 2024 with its worst start in years due to growing demand concerns.,"Microsoft overtook Apple as the world‚Äôs most valuable company on Thursday after the iPhone maker‚Äôs shares made a weak start to 2024 due to growing concerns over demand.
Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft were last up 1.6%, giving it a market valuation of $2.875 trillion as its early lead in the race to make money from generative artificial intelligence helped draw investors.
Apple was 0.9% lower with a market capitalization of $2.871 trillion ‚Äì the first time since 2021 that its valuation has fallen below that of Microsoft.
The Cupertino, California-based company‚Äôs stock has slid 3.3% in January as of last close, compared with a 1.8% rise in Microsoft.
‚ÄúIt was inevitable that Microsoft would overtake Apple since Microsoft is growing faster and has more to benefit from the generative AI revolution,‚Äù said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.
The weakness in Apple stock follows a series of rating downgrades that fanned worries that sales of the iPhone, its biggest cash cow, would stay weak, especially in major market China.
‚ÄúChina could be a drag on performance over the coming years,‚Äù brokerage Redburn Atlantic said in a client note on Wednesday, pointing to competition from a resurgent Huawei and Sino-U.S. tensions that have increased pressure on Apple.

The brokerage added Apple‚Äôs services business ‚Äì a bright spot in recent quarters ‚Äì faces threats as regulators deepen scrutiny of a lucrative deal that makes Google the default search engine on iOS.
Shares of Apple, whose market capitalization peaked at $3.081 trillion on Dec. 14, ended last year with a gain of 48%.
That was lower than the 57% rise posted by Microsoft, which aggressively rolled out genAI-powered tools in 2023 thanks to its tie-up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.
Microsoft has briefly taken the lead over Apple as the most valuable company a handful of times since 2018, most recently in 2021 when concerns about COVID-driven supply chain shortages hit the iPhone maker‚Äôs stock price.

Currently, Wall Street is more positive on Microsoft. The company has no ‚Äúsell‚Äù rating and nearly 90% of the brokerages covering the company recommend buying the stock.
Apple has two ‚Äúsell‚Äù ratings and only two-thirds of the analysts covering the company rate it a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù.
Both the stocks look relatively expensive in terms of price to their expected earnings, a common method of valuing publicly listed companies.

Sandeep Reddy Vanga wanted to cast Nani in a ‚Äòsoft love story‚Äô: ‚ÄòProducer told me no and gave me four choices‚Äô,Sandeep Reddy Vanga and Nani spoke at length about their respective careers in a recent interaction. The Animal director opened up about how he wanted Nani to play the lead in his film.,"Director Sandeep Reddy Vanga and Telugu star Nani came together for an interesting conversation about their respective films Animal and Hi Nanna. While Sandeep‚Äôs film is about a toxic relationship between a father and son, Nani‚Äôs upcoming movie promises to be a moving tale about a single father and his daughter, who yearns for a mother‚Äôs love. The common factor in both films is that they are about fathers, and that brought Sandeep and Nani together for a conversation with iDream Media. 
During the interaction, Sandeep shared an interesting story about how he wanted to cast Nani as his hero in a soft romantic film. Sandeep was right out of film school and was looking for a direction opportunity. He got a chance to narrate a script to a producer. The filmmaker said, ‚ÄúI want to share one thing with you. In 2010-2011, I was out of film school and was working as an AD in a film. Then one producer asked me to tell a story. That time, I had seen one of your films called Ride. I have worked with theatre artists at film school and I have some experience. So, when I saw the film I was impressed by your modulation. I hadn‚Äôt seen your first film Ashta Chamma then. So, I was like, ‚ÄòWho is this guy‚Ä¶ he has the modulation of a mass hero‚Ä¶ has great expressions.‚Äô So, I had this love story, I still have it. It is a nice soft love story. I narrated the story to the producer.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/telugu/sandeep-reddy-vanga-wanted-to-cast-nani-in-a-soft-love-story-but-producer-rejected-it-9050076/,entertainment
Reacher Season 2 review: Alan Ritchson series delivers the goods,"The story-telling in Reacher Season 2 is basic, but it gets the job done without wasting any time, and it‚Äôs all just as it should be, for Reacher fans.","Reacher is back. And all‚Äôs well with the world. Or will be, as soon as he and his three pals‚Äì whose bonds go back to the time when they were in the military together‚Äìrumble the bad guys, destroy them, and, as best-selling author Lee Child has them succinctly declare, ‚Äòpiss on their ancestors‚Äô grave.‚Äô End of matter.
In season one, we were introduced to Alan Ritchson, who instantly fixed the major problem with the two feature films in which Tom Cruise tried being Jack Reacher: Ritchson was six feet plus, as big horizontally as he was vertically, just the way Child‚Äôs eponymous hero ought to have been, instead of the compact Cruise.
It was impossible to buy the suave Hollywood star as the big-as-a-boardwalk ex-Army drifter who lives rough, packs a toothbrush as his only luggage, refuses to be tied down by real estate-and-paperwork, and roams around the US countryside, passing through small towns in which live big villains, dealing with them the only way he knows how: getting in his massive blow, or head-butt, first.
ADVERTISEMENT
In season 2, based on Child‚Äôs 11th novel ‚ÄòBad Luck And Trouble‚Äô, and developed by Nick Santora, he looms even larger, and is as fearsome. This time around, things have got personal: a member of his old Army unit has been murdered in the most brutal fashion, and it looks like someone has it in for the rest of them. Back when they were a tightly-knit band, they had a saying: you do not mess with the Special Investigators. Now someone clearly has, and as far as Reacher is concerned, that‚Äôs the end of that someone. Or someones.
The three friends who get together with Reacher on this mission are remnants of that old unit. Their addition makes things more interesting, especially when we need a bit of chatter in between all the action: thumping people with his bare hands is the big man‚Äôs forte; he leaves conversation to other people. Frances Neagley (Maria Sten), whom we met briefly in the first season, is back with her sharp sleuthing instincts: David O‚ÄôDonnell (Shaun Sipos) as the spiffy knife-man, and Karla Dixon ( Serinda Swan) as the numbers whizz, slip into step smoothly, as we follow them from New York to Vegas and all kinds of places in between as they start tracking those who killed their friends.

In the first season in early 2022, we got all the episodes at once. This new series has launched with three episodes together, followed by one every week. Five episodes down, three to go, and we‚Äôve had one-on-one combats, car crashes, gun battles, cops-hot-the-trail-of-Reacher, a very bad guy leaving a trail of bodies in his wake, fancy weapon prototypes, dirty drugs dealers, bent arms manufacturers. Bone-crunching, blood-spraying, hit-‚Äôem-till-they-are-dead fast-paced scenes follow each other: the story-telling is basic, but it gets the job done without wasting any time, and it‚Äôs all just as it should be, for Reacher fans. We‚Äôre going to do a whole lot of cowboy shit, declares Reacher, as the fifth episode comes to an end, and that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm here for.
While I wait impatiently for the next, and the next, I‚Äôm back to re-reading the book, and it is as much of an adrenalin-pump as it always is.",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/web-series/reacher-season-2-review-alan-ritchson-series-delivers-the-goods-9087438/,entertainment
"Fed keeps rates unchanged, Powell hedges on possible end of tightening campaign","The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers struggled to determine whether financial conditions may be tight enough already to control inflation, or whether an economy that continues to outperform expectations may need still more restraint.","The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday as policymakers struggled to determine whether financial conditions may be tight enough already to control inflation, or whether an economy that continues to outperform expectations may need still more restraint.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the situation remained something of a riddle, with U.S. central bank officials willing to raise rates again if progress on inflation stalls, wary that a rise in market-based interest rates may begin to weigh on the economy in a significant way, and trying not to disrupt, any more than necessary, an ongoing dynamic of steady job and wage growth.
In a press conference after the end of a two-day policy meeting, Powell said the better course of action for now, given the uncertainties, was to maintain the Fed‚Äôs benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, and see how job and price data evolve between now and the next policy meeting in December.
ADVERTISEMENT
Roughly 20 months into the Fed‚Äôs aggressive tightening of monetary policy, Powell said it remained unclear whether overall financial conditions were yet restrictive enough to tame inflation that he still considers to be far above the central bank‚Äôs 2% target.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not confident that we haven‚Äôt, we‚Äôre not confident that we have‚Äù reached that sufficiently restrictive plateau, Powell told reporters. ‚ÄúInflation has been coming down, but it‚Äôs still running well above our 2% target ‚Ä¶ A few months of good data are only the beginning of what it will take to build confidence.‚Äù
Annual inflation, based on the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure, was 3.4% in September for the third month in a row. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, it was 3.7%, little changed from August.
Asked if the Fed maintained a bias towards hiking rates versus keeping policy on hold, Powell responded ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the question we‚Äôre asking. Should we hike more?‚Äù
MARKET RATES IN FOCUS
ADVERTISEMENT
But the Fed chief also acknowledged that a recent market-driven rise in Treasury bond yields, home mortgage rates and other financing costs could have their own impact on the economy as long as they persist, and Fed officials will be watching those effects closely as they consider whether to hike the central bank‚Äôs policy rate again.
‚ÄúThese higher Treasury yields are showing through to higher borrowing costs for households and businesses. Those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists,‚Äù Powell said, taking particular note of 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages that are nearing 8%, close to a 25-year high.
Powell‚Äôs comments elaborated on a policy decision and statement that, while leaving the Fed‚Äôs benchmark rate unchanged for the second consecutive meeting, also took stock of what he called the ‚Äúoutsized‚Äù 4.9% annual pace of U.S. economic growth in the July-September period after a surge of consumer spending.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúEconomic activity expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter,‚Äù the U.S. central bank said in its statement after policymakers unanimously agreed to leave rates unchanged. The language marked an upgrade to the ‚Äúsolid pace‚Äù of activity the Fed saw as of its September meeting.
U.S. stocks climbed after the release of the policy statement and closed higher on the day, while the U.S. dollar pared gains and ended flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell and traders of short-term U.S. interest rates added to bets the Fed was done raising its policy rate and would start cutting rates by June of next year.
‚ÄúThe statement leans to the dovish side,‚Äù said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ‚ÄúThe fact that they left rates unchanged for the second time in a row suggests the Fed might leave rates unchanged in December. And if they do, that means the Fed is done.‚Äù
Though markets think the Fed‚Äôs rate-hiking campaign may be finished, data pointing to a stronger-than-expected economy and labor market have kept the prospect of another hike on the table.
Powell noted that much about the economy‚Äôs recent performance was constructive, with low unemployment and rising wages fueling more demand for goods and services and more job creation ‚Äì the sort of virtuous cycle that, within bounds, leads to self-sustaining growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
The issue for the Fed is whether conditions remain so robust that progress on inflation stalls or even reverses.
‚ÄúIt has been good,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this ‚Ä¶ The question is, how long can that continue?‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
The odds, he said, are that a slowdown of some sort will be needed, with the Fed committed to finding the policy stance that makes it happen.
‚ÄúIt is still likely ‚Ä¶ we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market ‚Ä¶ to fully restore price stability,‚Äù Powell said.
ADVERTISEMENT
His comments throw the focus onto upcoming employment and inflation data, with the release of the Labor Department‚Äôs monthly jobs report on Friday the first major piece of data that will shape the Fed‚Äôs deliberations for its December meeting.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/us-fed-keeps-rates-unchanged-powell-hedges-possible-end-tightening-campaign-9010666/,business
Zarin Shihab on beautifully conveying significant emotions without explosions in Aattam: ‚ÄòThe most challenging aspects I face‚Ä¶‚Äô,"Zarin Shihab, who made her silverscreen debut in The Family Man, is eagerly awaiting the theatrical release of her film Aattam, after captivating viewers at the 28th IFFK with her performance in the Anand Ekarshi movie.","Not many aspiring actors manage to land a launch like Zarin Shihab did back in 2019. Despite having only limited screen time in Raj & DK‚Äôs spy thriller series The Family Man, Zarin skillfully portrayed the character Sahaya Mary, a nurse pivotal to the show‚Äôs plot, leaving a lasting impression on viewers with her debut performance. Nevertheless, she has been selective in her acting choices, prioritising quality over quantity since then. As a result, Zarin is now gaining significant recognition, especially in her homeland of Kerala, through films and roles that inspire her to push her creative boundaries.
The latest addition to her brief yet impressive filmography is Anand Ekarshi‚Äôs debut feature Aattam (The Play), which premiered at the 28th IFFK, receiving rave reviews. Now, as the film prepares for its theatrical release on January 5, Zarin, whose performance captivated viewers at IFFK, eagerly anticipates the broader audience‚Äôs opinions. At its core, the film revolves around a woman who experiences sexual assault in a space she had considered safe and Zarin plays the role of Anjali, the only female member of a drama troupe called Arangu, comprising 12 male actors along with the director.

OnePlus 12 vs Samsung Galaxy S24+: Which flagship phone wins?,"OnePlus has the best of hardware, while the Samsung shines with its software.","If you are looking for a new flagship Android smartphone under Rs 1,00,000 in 2024, the newly launched OnePlus 12 and the Galaxy S24+ should be on your radar. Despite lacking the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù moniker, these two smartphones offer premium design, top-of-the-line specifications, and the latest software experience. However, there is a drastic price difference between the two phones. Here is how OnePlus‚Äôs latest flagship stacks up against the Samsung Galaxy S24+.
Design: Continuing the legacy of their predecessors
The OnePlus 12 (review) and the Samsung Galaxy S24+ are two drastically different-looking smartphones. While both mimic their predecessors, there are enough minor but important changes that help them stand out from the crowd.
Both the OnePlus 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S24+ feature a glass-metal sandwich design. The OnePlus 12 has a curved display and a curved back panel, whereas the Galaxy S24+ has a more subtle but practical flat display and a flat frame, reminiscent of the iPhone 15 (review).
In terms of ingress protection, the Galaxy S24+ is ahead of the OnePlus 12 with its IP68 rating. Both phones make use of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for protection. The OnePlus 12 boasts additional features like an alert slider and an IR blaster, providing added advantages. From their design ID, one can easily identify the brand from a distance.
Display: Two different takes
As mentioned earlier, the OnePlus 12 not only has a curved display but also packs in a slightly bigger 6.82-inch screen, while the Galaxy S24+ has a 6.7-inch screen. Both phones support LTPO technology (variable refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz) and offer QHD+ resolution, making these some of the sharpest smartphone displays on the market.
Considering the different implementations, some might feel the OnePlus 12 is a more premium smartphone, while others might prefer the flat display of the Galaxy S24+. It‚Äôs also worth noting that it is easier to find and install a screen protector on a flat display compared to a curved display. Additionally, for gamers, the Galaxy S24+ with a flat display could be an added advantage.
Camera: Flagship grade cameras
The OnePlus 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S24+ feature a triple camera setup at the back. The OnePlus 12, with its Hasselblad branding and a periscope-type zoom lens, looks unique, while the three individual cameras on the Galaxy S24+ are all about practicality.
ADVERTISEMENT
The OnePlus 12 boasts a 50 MP wide-angle lens, a 48 MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 64 MP telephoto lens. Similarly, the Galaxy S24+ features a 50 MP primary wide-angle lens, a 12 MP ultra-wide-angle lens, and a 10 MP telephoto lens. The OnePlus 12 comes equipped with a 32 MP selfie camera, while the Galaxy S24+ has a 12 MP shooter. Both phones can shoot up to 8K videos with the primary camera and 4K videos with the selfie cameras.
The camera performance of these smartphones will depend on software tuning, and it is expected that the Galaxy S24+ will have a slight edge over the OnePlus 12‚Äôs camera setup in real-world scenarios.
Performance: Different platforms
The OnePlus 12 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 and the Galaxy S24+ is based on the Exynos 2400 SoC (in India). Both being based on the flagship processors should deliver a great performance and premium smartphone user experience. Both phones ship with Android 14 OS but with different skins. The OnePlus 12 offers OxygenOS 14, while the Galaxy S24+ comes with OneUI 6.1.
Even for heavy users, these devices should deliver great performance on tasks like gaming or even video editing. While the OnePlus 12 is promised to receive four major OS upgrades, the Galaxy S24+ will get seven years of software support, the highest in the industry.

Galaxy S24+ has an edge over OnePlus 12 in AI
The AI-powered Galaxy S24+ offers several generative-AI packed features such as live call translation and transcription, wallpaper generator, image editing, and a new feature called Circle to Search, which was recently made available on the Google Pixel 8 series of smartphones.
Some of these features make use of on-device AI capabilities while the others depend on the cloud, however, despite having the required hardware, the OnePlus 12 does not have any on-device generative AI capabilities as of now.
Battery: OnePlus takes over Samsung
The OnePlus 12 not only has a bigger 5,400 mAh battery, but it also supports fast 100W fast charging and 50W fast wireless charging. The Galaxy S24+ on the other hand has a significantly smaller 4,900 mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging and 15W wireless charging, the bigger battery and the fast charging should give the OnePlus 12 an edge over the Galaxy S24+ both in terms of battery life and charging speed.
Verdict: Phones with different character
The OnePlus 12 is currently the best non-foldable phone that the company has ever made. However, while the Galaxy S24+ isn‚Äôt the best from Samsung, it is clearly one of the best from the South Korean tech giant. The hardware on the OnePlus 12 is undoubtedly more impressive than that of the Galaxy S24+, while the software experience on the Galaxy S24+ is on another level, thanks to the Galaxy AI features.

The opener, who suffered a concussion and also sufferer a hairline fracture on his elbow, missed the second innings in Delhi with Matt Renshaw coming in as a replacement.
The 36-year-old has been enduring a poor run of form with the bat and questions are being raised over his spot in the squad. There are fears that the left-hander may have already played his last Test as Australia might ring in some changes before the Ashes in June-July.
Warner has been averaging 26.39 from his last 14 Tests and has reached 50 in just three of his 24 innings.

GST evasion of Rs 1.51 lakh- crore detected till October; 71 notices to online gaming companies,"The government has amended the GST law, making it mandatory for overseas online gaming companies to register in India from October 1.","About Rs 1.51 lakh crore of tax evasion was detected by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) authorities till October in the financial year 2023-24, with Maharashtra, Haryana and Gujarat among the states with the highest amount of evasion, data shared by the Finance Ministry in Parliament showed. As many as 71 show cause notices have been issued to online gaming companies for alleged GST evasion of over Rs 1.12 lakh crore during financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24, reply to another question by the ministry stated.
Meanwhile, under its special drive, GST authorities detected tax evasion of Rs 24,010 crore and 21,791 non-existent entities, another reply by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated. Out of the total 21,791 entities whose GST registrations were discovered to be non- existent, 11392 entities pertained to state tax jurisdictions and 10,399 entities pertained to CBIC jurisdiction. State authorities detected Rs 8,805 crore of tax evasion, while Central authorities detected evasion of Rs 15,205 crore during the special drive.
For the total GST evasion of Rs 1.51 lakh crore detected by central GST officers in the current fiscal (till October 2023), 154 persons were arrested. A recovery of Rs 18,541 crore has been made so far this fiscal, the ministry said. This compares with detection of over Rs 1.31 lakh crore as evasion in financial year 2022-23, with recovery of Rs 33,226 crore, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary.

To the other question in the Rajya Sabha by BJP MP Sushil Kumar Modi on the amount of tax evasion and number of show cause notices issued to online gaming companies, Chaudhary said: ‚Äú71 show cause notices involving GST to the tune of Rs 1,12,332 cr have been issued to online gaming companies during financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24 (up to October 2023).

Kombari Vettapuli song hints Dhanush‚Äôs Captain Miller was a demure guy in the past,"A new single from Dhanush's Captain Miller is out, and it seems to be from the backstory of the lead hero when he was a shy young lad. ","Captain Miller‚Äôs trailer assured that the film, like Arun Matheshwaran‚Äôs earlier movies and like every other star vehicle these days, will be a blood bath. The trailer‚Äôs background score, like in the trailers of Kamal Haasan‚Äôs Viswaproopam and Vikram‚Äôs Dhruvanatchathiram, was made of bullet and bomb sounds. The promo teemed with bodies blowing up, heads getting pulverised by bullets and blood splashes. However, the new song from Captain Miller tells there is a calm (before the storm) segment in the film.
Titled ‚ÄúKombari Vettapuli‚Äù, the song, composed by GV Prakash and sung by Dhee, is a folksy number. Of course with Dhee‚Äôs rendition, it effortlessly generates a rural flavour. And the stills show Dhanush as this smitten young and working-class guy, who is lost in the beauty of Priya Arul Mohan‚Äôs character. She, on the other hand, seems to be a girl of an affluent background. However, what tells more about the film is lyricist Vivek‚Äôs lines.

Point to point rate of inflation based on CPI-AL (Consumer Price Index-Agricultural Labourers) and CPI-RL (Consumer Price Index-Rural Labourers) stood at 7.22 per cent and 7.34 per cent, respectively in October 2022, a labour ministry statement said.
Food inflation stood at 8.42 per cent and 8.18 per cent for CPI-AL and CPI-RL in October 2023 compared to 8.06 per cent and 7.73 per cent respectively in September 2023 and 7.05 per cent and 7.00 per cent respectively during the corresponding month of the previous year.

According to the statement, the major contribution towards the rise in general index of Agricultural Labourers and Rural Labourers came from food group to the extent of 13.20 points and 12.48 points respectively mainly due to increase in prices of rice, wheat atta, pulses, vegetables, milk, onion, chillies (green), mixed spices etc.

This is how the ghost came to be. Around 1,500 years ago, a massive star in our galaxy ran out of nuclear fuel. And then, it collapsed onto itself, in the process forming an extremely dense object called a neutron star.

Zelenskyy tells summit ‚Äòno place‚Äô for Russia at Olympics,The International Olympic Committee argues it would be discriminatory to exclude Russia and ally Belarus from sports ahead of the 2024 Paris Games.,"Russian athletes have ‚Äúno place‚Äù at next year‚Äôs Paris Olympics while their country‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine continues, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a summit of sports officials from about 30 countries Friday.
The International Olympic Committee argues it would be discriminatory to exclude Russia and ally Belarus from sports ahead of the 2024 Paris Games. With qualifying in many sports already under way, the IOC wants athletes from those countries to compete in a neutral capacity without national symbols.
‚ÄúWhile Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of the terrorist state have no place at sports and Olympic competitions,‚Äù Zelenskyy told the summit in an opening address by video link, according to a transcript issued by his office.
‚ÄúAnd it cannot be covered up with some pretended neutrality or a white flag. Because Russia is now a country that stains everything with blood ‚Äî even the white flag. It must be recognized. And this must be recognized, in particular, at the level of the International Olympic Committee,‚Äù Zelenskyy said. ‚ÄúThe International Olympic Committee needs honesty. Honesty it has unfortunately lost. Honesty that will help stop Russian terror and bring peace closer.‚Äù
Zelenskyy made surprise visits to Britain and France on Wednesday, pushing for fighter jets to battle Russian invaders in a dramatic speech to the British Parliament.
Friday‚Äôs summit meeting, which was held online and chaired by British Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, took place on a day of intense missile and drone strikes by Russian forces against Ukraine.
‚ÄúPresident Zelenskyy told the UK in Parliament this week of the suffering still being felt by many Ukrainians. As he did so the IOC was continuing to ignore the international allies stepping up their efforts for peace and disregard how the Olympics will give (Russian President Vladimir) Putin the perfect platform to promote Russia and legitimize his illegal war,‚Äù Frazer said in a statement Thursday.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ukrainian Sports Minister Vadym Guttsait said allowing Russians to compete would further traumatize athletes affected by the war.
‚ÄúThe participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in international competitions will make it impossible for Ukrainian athletes to take part in them, because each of the Ukrainians suffered from Russian aggression in one way or another: They lost their relatives and friends, lost their homes, received psychological trauma, lost the opportunity to do what they love,‚Äù Guttsait, who also leads the Ukrainian Olympic Committee, wrote in a letter to IOC president Thomas Bach and other Olympic leaders that was published Thursday.
Ukraine has previously made public a letter from Bach to Guttsait saying that ‚Äúthreatening a boycott ‚Ä¶ goes against the fundamentals of the Olympic Movement and the principles we stand for.‚Äù
Political leaders of Ukraine‚Äôs nearby allies in Poland and the Baltic states have said there could be Olympic boycotts if the IOC forges ahead with its plan. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has said Russian and Belarusian athletes should be barred from the Olympics in her city if the war is still going on by then.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hidalgo traveled to Kyiv on Thursday to meet Mayor Vitali Klitschko and said she would ‚Äúdo everything‚Äù to convince the IOC. Russian athletes previously competed at the Olympics without national symbols as punishment for doping cases, and using a similar approach to deal with a war is not appropriate, Hidalgo argued.
The IOC, which last year backed excluding Russians and Belarusians from sporting events on safety grounds, also faces challenges from within its own movement. It has given the federations running individual Olympic sports the final say on the details of readmitting Russian and Belarusian athletes. The sports could impose different rules and move at different speeds, or challenge the IOC‚Äôs authority entirely.
The governing body of archery said last week that it was ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù to allow any neutral athletes to compete in 2023, including at Olympic qualifiers. The IOC‚Äôs plan for Russians and Belarusians to qualify for the Olympics through competitions in Asia, instead of Europe, was not acceptable either, it added. The governing body of track and field has its own restrictions on the Russian team because of doping and its president, Olympic great Sebastian Coe, has said his preferred solution would be for Russia to ‚Äúget out of Ukraine.‚Äù
Olympic qualifiers are under way in some sports and start soon in many more. That leaves federations to grapple with how to reshape a process that they thought was finalized years ago.
ADVERTISEMENT
It could also be up to them to implement the IOC‚Äôs plan to leave out Russian and Belarusian athletes deemed to be ‚Äúactively supporting the war in Ukraine.‚Äù The IOC hasn‚Äôt defined what constitutes support, while Russian officials have called it discriminatory and demanded the Olympic body scrap that condition entirely.
Ukraine is particularly concerned that Russian athletes from military sports clubs or who hold military ranks could compete.
‚ÄúIn Russia, sport is an element of politics, powerful propaganda, in this case the promotion of war,‚Äù Guttsait wrote to Bach.

India‚Äôs foreign trade crosses $800 billion mark in first six months of 2023: GTRI,"According to a GTRI analysis, exports of goods and services rose by 1.5 per cent to $385.4 billion during January-June this year, as against $379.5 billion in January-June 2022.","A healthy growth in India‚Äôs services segments has helped the country‚Äôs total exports and imports of goods and services to cross the USD 800 billion mark during the first half of 2023, despite a slowdown in global demand, think tank GTRI said in a report on Monday.
According to the analysis of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), exports of goods and services rose by 1.5 per cent to USD 385.4 billion during January-June this year, as against USD 379.5 billion in January-June 2022.
Imports, however, dipped by 5.9 per cent to USD 415.5 billion during the six months of this year, as against USD 441.7 billion in January-June 2022.

‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs foreign trade (exports and imports of merchandise and services) reached USD 800.9 billion during January-June 2023, exhibiting a decline of 2.5 per cent over the same period last year (January-June 2022),‚Äù the report said.
Standalone, goods exports dipped by 8.1 per cent to USD 218.7 billion, while imports contracted by 8.3 per cent to USD 325.7 billion.
On the other hand, services exports during the six months period grew by 17.7 per cent to USD 166.7 billion, while imports rose by 3.7 per cent to USD 89.8 billion.
‚ÄúData is showing modest decline due to weak global demand and losing competitiveness in labour intensive sectors. The decline in merchandise exports happened despite appreciating INR (Indian Rupee). INR/USD exchange rate appreciated from 76.16 in April 2022 to 82.18 in Apr 2023,‚Äù GTRI Co-founder Ajay Srivastava said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the world trade outlook for 2023 is weak due to a number of factors, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, high inflation, tighter monetary policy, and financial uncertainty.
‚ÄúBut these factors will soon be overshadowed by a spate of new subsidies and protectionist measures by the EU and USA. For example, in the first seven months of 2023 alone, the EU has introduced five regulations on climate change and trade, each of these are essentially measures to curb imports,‚Äù he said.
India should continue to focus on increasing product quality and supply chain competitiveness, he said, adding since every big country is into inward mode, India should not surrender its policy space especially in new issues in FTAs (free trade agreements) and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).
ADVERTISEMENT
He suggested the government be ready to use targeted and precise retaliation to counter unilateral policy decisions like CBAM (carbon border adjustment mechanism) or EU Deforestation Regulation.
India has done this effectively in 2019 by raising tariffs on the US products when the US in 2018 raised tariffs on steel and aluminium, he said.
The report stated that 11 of 29 product categories contributing to 25 per cent of India‚Äôs exports registered positive export growth during January-June 2023, over the same period last year.
Those sectors include Telecom, Computer and electronics items; Machinery, boilers, Turbines; Pharmaceuticals; ceramic products.
Smartphone exports jumped to USD 7.5 billion during January-June this year from USD 2.5 billion in January-June 2022.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, exports in 18 of 29 product categories contributing to 75 per cent of total merchandise exports declined during the period and that include cereals, vegetable, fruits, spices; fish, meat; dairy products; textiles, ; carpets, garments; footwear; and leather.
‚ÄúSmall firms active in labour intensive sectors face 10-15 cost disadvantages due to high cost of capital, low quality grid power, delays at the ports and higher compliance cost. PLI is not an answer to product categories where thousands of firms make the same products as it will put non recipients to disadvantage,‚Äù Srivastava said.
ADVERTISEMENT
He suggested that a horizontal scheme extending 2-3 per cent incentive to every firm in the sector will help in meeting some of the cost disability.
Further, the report said that India exports goods to 240 countries and out of that, the country‚Äôs outbound shipments declined in 134 destinations.

Union Budget 2024: Expectations from agriculture sector,It is expected that the agriculture budget for 2024-25 addresses multiple pain-points of the sector simultaneously.,"India‚Äôs growing population along with a constant rise in income levels is leading to a constant increase in demand for agricultural products and increasing burden on existing agricultural resources. The prevailing scenario indicates a need to improve productivity along with reducing costs and improving quality to make the most efficient use of the available resources. The growing adoption of cutting-edge agricultural techniques as well as incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI), geographic information systems (GIS), drones, and remote sensing-based technologies in agriculture is a step in the right direction.
Current challenges faced by the sector
Although the agriculture sector has transformed significantly over the last few decades, challenges like fragmented landholdings, low productivity, limited mechanization, minimal value addition opportunities and insufficient credit availability prevent farmers from realizing higher prices. Another major problem is inefficient extension mechanisms, which makes it difficult for advanced agricultural practices to reach each and every farmer. Due to this farmers still use basic, traditional methods for cultivation.

Heartache at Cape Town: BCCI should stop the musical chairs of coaches for Indian women‚Äôs cricket team,"Given the youth and the system they come up in, the women's team needs support staff who are technically well equipped and can assist them tactically on the field.","Teary eyes. Face buried into their palms. Folded hands seeking supernatural help. Laughs giving way to grim faces. A few cheers here and there whenever hope shot up. Stunned faces as the familiar heartbreak finale closed in. A collective sigh in the end followed by free-flowing tears. Senior players and support staff once again left quizzing themselves how to pick up the pieces and move on. And a run out that will haunt a lifetime.
This heartache is not new to Women in Blue. From the time they made it to the final of the 50-over World Cup in 2017, where they collapsed near the finish line against England, they have gone through such phases regularly in ICC events. A year later, they lost to England in the T20 World Cup semifinals in the Caribbean; two years later to Australia at Melbourne in the final of the T20 World Cup. Last year, as cricket returned to the Commonwealth Games, they settled for silver losing to Australia in the final in Birmingham.
And now this at Cape Town, where they lost the semifinals by 5 runs to Australia. Like in the case of CWG final and the 2017 World Cup final, India were on course for a statement win ‚Äì Australia had no answers to Harmanpreet Kaur ‚Äî only for the unlucky dismissal of their captain to ensure the story repeated itself.

  A post shared by ICC (@icc)
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult to control myself. I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Harmanpreet said. ‚ÄúRight now, I am sitting in a hangover. I don‚Äôt understand how it is going on. But after this, when we go to the room, we will know how many more days it will take. But I think we played good cricket. That‚Äôs all I can say,‚Äù she said.
Dropped catches, poor fielding, mix-ups in the middle, failure to close down important moments‚Ä¶ all had a role to play in India‚Äôs downfall. For a team that aspires to be the powerhouse in women‚Äôs cricket, they still have plenty to make up on the field.
It‚Äôs vital that India and the BCCI go back to the drawing board and have a vision in place and ensure continuity when it comes to support staff. Last December, with just two months left for the tournament, the BCCI chose to shuffle ‚Äì the team has had three different head coaches for each of the three last three T20 World Cups. In an internal shuffle that had few signs of coming, Ramesh Powar, who has been the head coach since 2021, was assigned to the men‚Äôs wing of the National Cricket Academy.
Hrishikesh Kanitkar who had been handling the men‚Äôs Under-19 and A teams along with the senior women‚Äôs team as a batting consultant, was put in charge of the team for the T20 World Cup. To assist him, the BCCI had Troy Cooley ‚Äì a fast bowling coach that the team felt was necessary for South Africa conditions. With Powar not around, and spin being one of their team‚Äôs strongest suits, there was none to assist the likes of Deepti Sharma, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Radha Yadav and Devika Vaidya.

In their most important league match against England, the Indian spinners were out-bowled by their counterparts, and a defeat meant they ended-up playing Australia in the semifinals. For a team that is still in the developmental stage, having a strong support staff is essential and so is continuity in terms of planning.
Make no mistake, this team is not similar to the men‚Äôs side, which prefers more of a man-manager than a tactically nuanced coach. Given the youth and the system they come up in, the women‚Äôs team needs a bunch of support staff who are technically well equipped and can assist them tactically on the field.
Top teams that regularly vie for top prizes all have continuity in planning and let the process take over. But by constantly changing coaches almost every couple of years, be it the players or the BCCI are not giving themselves a best chance to win. Coaches, like captains and selectors are normally appointed from one 50-over World Cup cycle to another, which includes two T20 World Cups. However, Indian teams, under Mithali Raj and Harmanpreet, seems an exception to it and unsurprisingly continues to pay the price.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/heartache-at-cape-town-bcci-should-stop-the-musical-chairs-of-coaches-for-indian-womens-cricket-team-8463322/,sports

They also share a warm relationship with their father (Johny Antony). Viji, a local casanova, has a history of multiple girlfriends but is contemplating jilting all of them to focus on one, only because she comes from a wealthy family. Meanwhile, Ajeesh plans to marry his girlfriend Kavya (Sruthy Jayan), who belongs to an upper caste and hence she is eloping from her home.

Delhi HC permits St Stephen‚Äôs College to hold interviews for minority seat admissions,"Earlier this year, the St Stephen's College filed the present petition against DU's notification, contending that being a minority educational institution, its right to select students for admission and administer educational institution under the Constitution cannot be interfered with or taken away.","The Delhi High Court has permitted the St Stephen‚Äôs College to conduct interviews for granting admission to students under the minority quota besides taking into consideration their common university entrance test scores.
A bench headed by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma similarly permitted the Jesus and Mary College to hold interviews for the seats reserved for minority category students.
The court‚Äôs order came on applications by the two minority colleges to stay a December 8, 2022, decision of the executive council of the Delhi University (DU) insisting on 100 percent weightage for CUET 2023 score for admission to minority quota.
The applications were filed in petitions by the colleges challenging the notification.
Besides the pleas of the two colleges, the court order was also passed on a petition by a woman, Sharon Ann George, against the interviews for minority students at the St Stephen‚Äôs College in addition to the CUET.
The court, in its order, observed that in an earlier decision, it has already discussed the extent to which DU can regulate the admission of minority students and ruled that St Stephen‚Äôs has the right to conduct interviews with 15 per cent weightage for minority students, but not for non-minority students.
‚ÄúDespite this observation made by this Court in the aforesaid judgment, the Executive Committee in its meeting dated 08.12.2022 has decided that for the academic session 2023-24, admission to the Undergraduate Programmes shall solely be on the basis of CUET for minority seats also,‚Äù said the bench, also comprising Justice Subramaniam Prasad.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúAs an interim measure, this Court directs that the admission policy as framed by this Court vide judgment dated 12.09.2022 shall be followed for the Academic Year 2023-24 and the St Stephen‚Äôs College will adopt the marks secured in the CUET with 85% weightage for CUET and the College‚Äôs interview for shortlisted candidates with a weightage of 15% for Christian minority candidates,‚Äù the court directed in its order dated July 21.
The court said there is prima face a complete lack of reasoning as to why its earlier ruling has been ‚Äúgiven a go-by by the Respondents (DU) and indicates non-application of mind on their part while making the impugned decision‚Äù.
Admitting the petitions, the court opined that the colleges would suffer an irreparable loss if interim relief is not granted to them at this stage.
Senior advocate A Mariarputham and advocate Romy Chacko appeared for the petitioner colleges. Senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj appeared for petitioner George.
Last year, the St Stephen‚Äôs College had filed another petition challenging the DU‚Äôs letter asking it to withdraw its prospectus which gave 85 per cent weightage to CUET and 15 per cent to college interview for admission to its unreserved seats in UG courses.

‚ÄòBazball won‚Äôt die wondering‚Äô: Nasser Hussain warns India against preparing rank turners for Test series,Former England captain says the Indian management should ask for good pitches instead of turners for the five-match Test series.,"Former captain Nasser Hussain has warned India for not preparing rank turners for the five-match Test series against England, starting from January 25 in Hyderabad.
‚ÄúIf I am in the Indian management, I would ask for good pitches, that spin a bit. Because then their spinners and batters will out bat and out spin ours,‚Äù Nasser Hussain told Michael Atherton on the Sky Sports Cricket podcast.
‚ÄúIf they ask for pitches that spin a lot then it becomes a bit of a lottery and brings England‚Äôs spinners into the game. The way Bazball goes about its business, the way England‚Äôs batting goes, they won‚Äôt die wondering.‚Äù
England last won a Test series in India in 2012-13 under the captaincy of Alastair Cook where spin twins Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar starred in the momentous 2-1 triumph. Hussain also said that Indian fans are waiting to see how their side can put England‚Äôs Bazball strategy to bed.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of talk about Indian cricket and there‚Äôs been a lot of talk about Bazball,‚Äù said Hussain.

Sonodyne Malhar review: An Indian masterpiece that serves pure sound for the purists,This vintage-inspired speaker from Sonodyne Audio has a nostalgic vibe.,"Over time, it seems most of us have lost the context of pure sound. What we are used to these days via our headphones, televisions, and Bluetooth speakers is a cacophony of amped-up bass and synthetic sounds. Yes, audio has to be a very personal choice, but it has to be a choice where a user decides this is exactly how they want to listen to their music. Every once in a while an audio device comes along trying to underline the beauty of pure sound which is more natural and live. The Sonodyne Malhar is clearly in that range of products.
Made by Kolkata-based Sonodyne, the Malhar stands out the moment you pull it out of the box. This one comes with a heavy 8-kg wooden cabinet that has a beatbox-like look about it and clearly suggests it means business. There is also an air of simplicity that brings with it a hint of nostalgia for those like me who have been around for a while now. Malhar has two front-facing drivers and tweeters flanked by two side-facing radiators on the sides, together promising a wide soundstage with high fidelity.

The bright, sunny day makes the red-painted school stand out even more, and what adds to its ambience is students having fun recording each other on iPads, creating content as part of their curriculum. ‚ÄúHow can we combat pollution, when our surroundings are not clean?‚Äù asked Antara, a Grade 8 student, who was part of the classroom project where each group, called a station, was allowed a topic on pollution. They were required to create videos, posters, and brief presentations on the topic. But for the students it is beyond a classroom project, as this gives them an opportunity to share their perspectives on an issue that is pervasive in their everyday lives.

Intel says new ‚ÄòSierra Forest‚Äô chip to more than double power efficiency,"Intel said its ""Sierra Forest"" chip will have 240% better performance per watt than its current generation of data center chip, the first time the company has disclosed such figures.","Intel on Monday said a new data center chip coming out next year will handle more than double the amount of computing work that can be done for each watt of power used, part of a broader industry push to lower electricity consumption.
At a semiconductor technology conference held at Stanford University in Silicon Valley, Intel said its ‚ÄúSierra Forest‚Äù chip will have 240% better performance per watt than its current generation of data center chip, the first time the company has disclosed such figures.
The data centers that power the internet and online services consume huge amounts of electricity, and technology firms are increasingly facing pressure to hold steady or reduce the amount of energy they use. That has pushed chip companies to focus on how to get more computing work done per chip.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ampere Computing, a startup founded by ex-Intel executives, was first to market with a chip focused on handling cloud computing work efficiently. Intel and rival Advanced Micro Devices have followed suit by announcing similar products, with AMD‚Äôs offering hitting the market in June.
Intel, which has lost market share to AMD and Ampere in data centers, said on Monday its ‚ÄúSierra Forest‚Äù chip is on track to arrive next year.
The company is for the first time splitting its data center chips into two categories: A ‚ÄúGranite Rapids‚Äù chip that will focus on performance but consume more power, and the more efficient ‚ÄúSierra Forest‚Äù chip.
Ronak Singhal, a senior fellow at Intel, said the company‚Äôs customers can consolidate older software onto a smaller number of computers inside a data center.

‚ÄúI may have things that are four or five, six years old. I can get power savings by moving something that‚Äôs currently on five, 10 or 15 different servers into a single‚Äù new chip, Singhal said. ‚ÄúThat density drives their total cost of ownership.

"From entrepreneurship to design, mechanical engineering provides multiple opportunities, writes IIT Delhi professor","‚ÄúAs a mechanical engineer seeking to enhance human ability, the first requirement is to have social skills such as interpersonal abilities and empathy,‚Äù writes Mukherjee.","(A Lesson from IIT is a weekly column by an IIT faculty member on learning, science and technology on campus and beyond. The column appears every Friday)
‚Äî Sudipto Mukherjee
The word ‚Äúmachine‚Äù comes from an ancient Greek term, meaning a system of connected parts designed to do specific tasks, especially those that challenge human abilities.
Machines are created with a specific sense of purpose. They can help us control energy and make different types of motion possible. Today, machines can handle heavy tasks from shaping car bodies to measuring small movements in the nano-meter range.
Throughout history, people have known about weaving machines and machines powered by wind and water. These machines have contributed to India‚Äôs prosperity until around 1400 AD.
A Lesson from IIT | A Lesson from IIT: Computer Science remains top choice, but research-oriented fields important, writes former IIT-Guwahati director
After 1400 AD, there were significant advancements in machine development. Crucial to this is the influence of the ideas of a philosopher named Rene Descartes.
His belief: ‚Äúeverybody is a machine‚Äù. He reasoned that there is no fundamental difference between machines created by humans and living bodies created by a divine force, when considering the body alone.
Due to this line of reasoning, good minds shifted their focus from studying celestial motions to creating tools that improve human life in terms of food, clothing, and housing by overcoming the unpredictability of nature and individual differences.

This then led to progress in physics and mathematics. Now, we understand equations like F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration). But there are still many things we do not know. For example: we do not know why a piece of toast always falls with the buttered side down. From a distance, mechanical engineering conjures up images of fast motorcycles and sleek cars. The underlying symbolism of this is always financial rewards, intellectual stimulation, and long-term career satisfaction.
The field offers many opportunities for a successful career. One option is starting your own business. However, it is important to remember that if you choose to start a business, you will need to source work, bill, and collect payments. If you are not diligent in all these aspects, your business will not succeed. This is very different from working for a large company.

So, what does it take to become a good mechanical engineer? It is important to have a good relationship with computers early in your career. But as you seek to enhance human abilities and empower society, the first requirement is to have social skills such as interpersonal abilities and empathy.
Mechanical engineering is the right choice if you are passionate about solving physical challenges faced by humans in today‚Äôs world. The knowledge needed to provide solutions will come as you progress through a solid mechanical engineering curriculum, starting from identifying needs and ending with delivering the final product.
ADVERTISEMENT
Many of us know how to tie our shoelaces, but we rarely understand the details of the knot itself. Are flat laces better than round ones?
These are the kind of questions that mechanical engineering can help you answer. The branch of mechanical engineering that encourages asking such questions about everyday activities and delving into the details of current solutions to evolve means that are more efficient is called design. In mechanical design, we focus on the function sought by the user or society rather than the personal expression of the creator. This need for empathy sets mechanical engineers apart from artists, even though both create new forms.
Through training in mechanical engineering, we understand that providing a quality service usually involves more than just one component. It requires assembling parts and coordinating different people and machines across space and time. Teams and coordination within them are needed to execute them. We teach structured methods to efficiently handle one-time activities like projects, or to plan processes for repeatedly delivering a single product. This aspect of mechanical engineering is classically called industrial engineering and is the precursor to programmes in management and business administration. The curriculum obviously includes team-building skills, which will benefit you whether you succeed or face challenges once out in the workforce.

The world of mechanical engineering is not deterministic, meaning it does not operate based on specific occurrences, It works with expected values, such as statistical means and variance.
ADVERTISEMENT
Mechanical engineering is perhaps the only engineering discipline that sees designing with failure as an integral part of the design process and recognises that it is inevitable. We use terms like fatigue, wear, and pitting to describe the process of things degrading, and we have structured methods to estimate the useful life of components and plan for replacements.
Designs are rooted in data rather than personal opinions or individual experiences. Theory makes up about 40 per cent of the curriculum, with the rest being more focused on application. It is worth noting that sometimes mechanical components replace failing human joints and organs, although we haven‚Äôt yet figured out how to renew them over time like natural biological structures.
In addition to logical thinking, mechanical engineering also values visual thinking. It combines principles from physics and mathematics and allows you to use your mind and get your hands dirty. Computer tools play a big role in visualisation and digital representation, although the focus is often on using these tools rather than developing or maintaining them. Mechanical engineering is a good playing field for those who have empathy, an outward-looking mindset, resilience, and some mathematical skills.

Foreign demand stoked exports at the fastest pace since November. Firms expected activity to stay elevated over the coming year and the future output sub-index remained high at 65.3, albeit slightly lower than in June.
That optimism encouraged firms to hire more workers last month.
‚ÄúPressure continued to come on capacity, prompting firms to expand employment solidly again, a trend that is likely to continue in the months ahead should demand remain strong,‚Äù added Harker.

Mushtaq Khan recalls Shah Rukh Khan rejected a big film because he wasn‚Äôt happy with his role: ‚ÄòHe rejected such a big film when he was nothing‚Äô,"Mushtaq Khan shared an anecdote from Shah Rukh Khan's television days, revealing how the superstar turned down a role in a big film because he wasn't getting a meaty part.","Shah Rukh Khan began his acting journey in television before making his mark in films and ultimately becoming the ‚Äòbadshah‚Äô of Bollywood. In a recent interview, actor Mushtaq Khan shared an interesting anecdote from SRK‚Äôs television days, revealing how the superstar turned down a role in a big film bankrolled by a reputed production house because he wasn‚Äôt getting a meaty part.
Speaking about the same, Mushtaq told Digital Commentary, ‚ÄúI acted in a television show with Shah Rukh Khan called Umeed. We shot for the show in Nashik. I understood back then that he won‚Äôt stay here for long. He asked me one day about producer Pranlal Mehta. I told him he is a big producer. Shah Rukh said that he is getting a lot of calls from the Pranlal. I said, ‚ÄòYou are getting calls from him, go and do that project with him.‚Äô He told me that he will wait and see, but I asked him not to wait any longer and just do the project. He then decided to think about it for 2-3 days before responding to the producer. After 4-5 days, he told me that he won‚Äôt be doing that project and I was shocked. I told him, ‚ÄòPagal ho gaeya hai (You have gone mad). You don‚Äôt know how big is the production house and the director helming the film has delivered hits in the past.'‚Äù

"Indian Open: Yannik Paul tops leaderboard, Baisoya leads the way on good day for Indians",The Indian contingent ‚Äì used to the challenging nature of the course at the DLF Club in Gurugram ‚Äì put up an impressive display in the first round of the golf tournament.,"Each of the four top 100 golfers at the Indian Open this year, playing on the tricky terrain of the Gary Player Course of the DLF Golf and Country Club in Gurugram, failed to register a score under par in the first round on Thursday.
In-form Dane Thorbj√∏rn Olesen, fresh off his win at the Thailand Classic, was one over par, and Spain‚Äôs Pablo Larrazabal hit a par score of 72. Elsewhere, Scotland‚Äôs Robert MacIntrye was two over, and Japan‚Äôs Kazuki Higa three over par.
Defending champion Scott Gallacher also had a poor day, finishing five over par, while Team Europe‚Äôs Ryder Cup vice-captain, Denmark‚Äôs Thomas Bjorn, finished one over.
There were some exceptions ‚Äì Germany‚Äôs Yannik Paul had a brilliant flourish in the end, hitting four successive birdies in the final four holes to top the leaderboard by finishing seven under par. But for the most part, those unfamiliar with this challenging course, struggled.
With testing conditions with the wind picking up in the second half of the day, the experienced Indian contingent were able to take advantage of those struggles.
Honey Baisoya, a regular here given his sponsorship with DLF, was second on the leaderboard by hitting 66 and finishing six under par. The Delhi-based 26-year-old hit eight birdies, but one double bogey ‚Äì on the 14th hole ‚Äì which he felt was his only error of the round. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how DLF is, if you make one bad shot, you‚Äôre going to come up with a bogey or even a double,‚Äù he told media later.
The 16th, 17th, and 18th holes at this course have been spoken about with a fair bit of caution all week. Baisoya, like Paul after him, managed them well, with two pars and a birdie, but warned that it required some attention to detail.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúYou really need to focus on these three holes in particular,‚Äù he said. ‚Äú. My goal was just to keep the ball in play (smiles), keep it on the center of the green, and get the putts going.‚Äù
Course record-holder Shubhankar Sharma was tied-four on the day, after his four under par score was equalled by Angad Cheema. Shubhankar, the highest-ranked Indian in the event, was pleased with his back nine, but regretted some of his early holes.
‚ÄúSometimes you don‚Äôt make too many mistakes, but even good shots don‚Äôt get the result and that happened a couple of times with me on the back nine (front nine for him since he teed-off from the 10th) where I made two bogeys, but I was playing well,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúThe course is playing tough. And as the wind has picked up, it hasn‚Äôt been easy.‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
When asked, Baisoya had a pretty clear-cut response as to why the Indians had succeeded in Gurugram on day one: ‚ÄúBecause we play here a lot (laughs). I come here every day. So I play every day on this golf course.‚Äù
Eyes were also focused on Manu Gandas, the 26-year-old topper of the PGTI Order of Merit after winning six successive titles last year. Manu got his round off to a solid start, hitting three birdies on the front nine, before falling off to hit 70 and finish two under par.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/golf/indian-open-yannick-paul-tops-leaderboard-baisoya-leads-the-way-on-good-day-for-indians-8463189/,sports
"Italy proposes bank tax to help people with interest rate hikes, sending stocks plunging","Transport Minister Matteo Salvini announced the tax at a Monday evening press conference, saying it was a measure of ‚Äúsocial equity‚Äù to make up for a series of interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank.","Italian bank stocks plunged Tuesday after the Cabinet approved a proposal to apply a 40% tax on some bank profits this year to help consumers and businesses cope with higher borrowing costs.
Transport Minister Matteo Salvini announced the tax at a Monday evening press conference, saying it was a measure of ‚Äúsocial equity‚Äù to make up for a series of interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank. Those increases are aimed at fighting inflation and make it more expensive for people to get loans to buy homes and cars or for companies to get new equipment or build facilities.
UniCredit shares fell over 7%, Intesa Sanpaolo was down more than 8%, Banco BPM dropped more than 8.5%, and BPER and Banca MPS both plummeted over 10% in early afternoon trading on the Milan Stock Exchange.
ADVERTISEMENT
The Association of Italian Banks has not yet commented publicly on the tax, whose approval apparently took banks by surprise. Analysts said banks would surely try to change the proposal or challenge it in court if it‚Äôs passed by Parliament, the next step in the process.
The five major Italian banks reported a combined net profit of about 10.5 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in the first half of the year, up 64% from the same period in 2022, according to credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar. It pointed to higher interest income, resilient fees and cost management.
The 40% tax would be applied to banks‚Äô profits from the difference between the interest they pay customers on deposits and the interest they earn on loans. Salvini said the tax revenue would amount to ‚Äúa few billion‚Äù euros that would be used to fund tax breaks and help first-time homeowners get mortgages. ‚ÄúIt is a levy on banks‚Äô extra profits,‚Äù he said, adding that the measure was proposed by Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti, who didn‚Äôt attend the press conference to announce it.
The proposal must now be converted into legislation and be approved by Italy‚Äôs Parliament, where the right-wing government enjoys a comfortable majority. ‚ÄúBanks are widely expected to push back against the measure during the parliamentary process, but within the ruling coalition, there is a solid component supporting the move,‚Äù Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at Teneo consultancy, said in a statement. ‚ÄúAbsent significant amendments before its parliamentary approval, the retroactive tax will likely be challenged in the courts.‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
The drop in Italian bank shares weighed on major banks more broadly in European markets, with Germany‚Äôs Deutsche Bank, France‚Äôs BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, Britain‚Äôs HSBC and Spain‚Äôs Banco Santander all falling in early afternoon trading.
The ECB has raised interest rates nine straight times in its campaign to stamp out high inflation unleashed by higher energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine and supply chain backups as the global economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. The bank tax was the last item announced in a series of measures adopted by Italy‚Äôs Cabinet in its final meeting before a summer pause, ranging from ending mandatory isolation for COVID-19 cases to a decision to increase the number of taxis that can operate.
The 20% increase in the number of taxi licenses that cities can issue is aimed at better responding to a boom in tourism that has created long lines at taxi stands this summer, with demand only expected to grow with the Vatican‚Äôs 2025 Jubilee, the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina and a view to Rome‚Äôs bid to host the 2030 Expo.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/italy-proposes-bank-tax-to-help-people-with-interest-rate-hikes-sending-stocks-plunging-8882683/,business
"Vetrimaaran: ‚ÄòIf you are not taking a stand, it means you are standing by the oppressor‚Äô",Filmmaker Vetrimaaran in a roundtable spoke about recent Tamil films and the social justice movement that they have brought about.,"Director Vetrimaaran has lately been making films about oppression. Be it Asuran, a bloody tale of a socially backward farmer, or his latest film, Viduthalai Part 1, an anti-establishment film about the violence meted out by police in tribal villages, the director has been making powerful statements with his movies. Speaking about the same, Vetrimaaran, at the roundtable of Cinema Express, credited director Pa Ranjith for the movement. He also shared his thoughts on social justice, and how an individual shouldn‚Äôt shy away from standing up for the oppressed.
When asked what‚Äôs his view about people who can afford not to take a stand when it comes to issues that films like Viduthalai and Maamannan deal with, Vetrimaaran said, ‚ÄúImagine a couple is fighting on the road. And the man is beating the woman. If you just pass by without interfering because it is their issue, you are supporting the man. There is no one called a by-stander. If you are not taking a stand when it comes to the issue of oppression, it means you are standing by the oppressor.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/vetrimaaran-if-you-are-not-taking-a-stand-it-means-you-are-standing-by-the-oppressor-9092437/,entertainment

Since its release, the film has faced criticism for its portrayal of alpha males and toxic masculinity. Javed Akhtar, speaking at the Ajanta-Ellora International Film Festival (AIFF), expressed concern about the film‚Äôs success, citing it as dangerous. However, he also pointed to the popularity of the song ‚ÄòCholi Ke Peeche Kya Hai‚Äô, which was a part of the 1993 film Khalnayak, and urged the audience to choose content wisely.
He said, ‚ÄúLog mujhe bolne lage hai ki ‚ÄòSaab aaj-kal kaise gaane hone lage hai‚Äô. Gaane toh 6-7 aadmi mil ke banate hai. Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, ek aadmi ne likha, do aadmi ne compose kiya, 2 ladkiyon ne dance kiya, ek cameraman ne shoot kiya. Yeh 8-10 log thodi problem hai. Problem yeh hai ki yeh gaana samaj mein superhit ho gaya tha. Yeh crore logon ko aacha laga tha. Yeh hume darr lagta hai. (People started telling me, ‚ÄòSir, what kind of songs are being made these days?‚Äô  Songs are created by 6-7 individuals. For Choli Ke Peeche Kya Hai, one person wrote it, two people composed it, two girls danced to it, and one cameraman shot it. These 8-10 people are not a problem. The problem is that this song became a superhit and was liked by crores of people. This scares us.)‚Äù

Big-spending Chelsea wrapping up busy end to transfer window,"The final day of the window was another busy one for Chelsea and its new American ownership, with the club negotiating with Benfica in the hope of signing Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez for a British-record fee of 105 million pounds ($130 million) after selling Jorginho to Premier League leader Arsenal.","Chelsea has already spent more in the January transfer window ‚Äî around $225 million ‚Äî than every club in the top leagues in Spain, Italy, Germany and France combined.
The London team might not be finished.
The final day of the window was another busy one for Chelsea and its new American ownership, with the club negotiating with Benfica in the hope of signing Argentina midfielder Enzo Fernandez for a British-record fee of 105 million pounds ($130 million) after selling Jorginho to Premier League leader Arsenal. Hakim Ziyech could also leave Chelsea to join Paris Saint-Germain on loan.
Seven players have already arrived at Stamford Bridge this month, including Ukraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk in a deal worth around $108 million and France center back Beno√Æt Badiashile for $40 million.
Cesare Casadei will spend the rest of the season on loan at Reading.

‚Äî Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) January 30, 2023
If Fernandez joins, that would take Chelsea‚Äôs spending up to around $350 million in January.
This comes after Chelsea spent around $280 million in Europe‚Äôs summer transfer window, the first under the new ownership fronted by Todd Boehly following the purchase of the club for $2.5 billion in May.
Chelsea has handed new players long contracts ‚Äî as much as 8 1/2 years for Mudryk, for example ‚Äî to allow the club to spread the cost of the signings over the length of the deal and comply with financial fair-play regulations.
Fernandez would be the most expensive signing of the lot, with the fee for the 22-year-old World Cup winner surpassing the 100 million pounds (then $139 million) Manchester City paid Aston Villa for Jack Grealish in 2021.

Fernandez only joined Benfica from Argentine club River Plate in August, for a reported fee of around $10 million.

Chelsea will hope its latest spending spree helps the team climb the Premier League standings ‚Äî it is currently in 10th place, 10 points off the top four ‚Äî in a late attempt to qualify for the Champions League.
JORGINHO TO ARSENAL
Italy international Jorginho has cost Arsenal a reported 12 million pounds ($14.75 million) in a move that gives the league leaders an extra option in midfield in their bid to win a first top-flight title since 2004.
Arsenal made a late move in the transfer window to strengthen its central-midfield department, with Mohamed Elneny ‚Äî a backup to first-choice holding midfielder Thomas Partey ‚Äî ruled out for a lengthy period Tuesday because of injury.
Attempts to sign Ecuador international Moises Caideco from Brighton were rebuffed last week, leading Arsenal to turn to Jorginho, who helped Italy win the European Championship in 2021.
üí¨ ‚ÄúJorginho is a midfield player with intelligence, deep leadership skills and a huge amount of Premier League and International experience. He has won in his career, but he still has the hunger and huge willingness to contribute here.‚Äù

Arsenal also loaned out midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga to Crystal Palace and 19-year-old Brazilian forward Marquinhos, who is midway through his first season at the club, to second-tier Norwich to get more first-team action.
CANCELO LEAVES CITY
Manchester City sent Joao Cancelo on loan to Bayern Munich for the rest of the season, with the Portugal fullback having fallen out of favor with manager Pep Guardiola since the World Cup.
The German champions have the option to make the transfer permanent for a fee of 70 million euros ($76 million).
Cancelo was one of City‚Äôs key players last season but Guardiola feels the team can do without the attacking, versatile defender after a recent tactical switch and the emergence of 18-year-old right back Rico Lewis.
TOTTENHAM‚ÄôS RIGHT BACKS

Tottenham manager Antonio Conte places a lot of importance in his wing backs and the club switched around the players on the right side on deadline day.
Spain wing back Pedro Porro joined from Sporting in Portugal on loan, with Tottenham obliged to buy him for a reported 39 million pounds ($48 million) at the end of the season. To make room in the squad, Tottenham sent Djed Spence on loan to Rennes in France and mutually agreed to the termination of Matt Doherty‚Äôs contract to enable him to join Atletico Madrid in Spain.
FOREST AND BOURNEMOUTH ACTIVE
Nottingham Forest and Bournemouth were busy bolstering their squads for their bids to avoid relegation from the Premier League.
Forest brought in three players ‚Äî the signature signing being Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas on loan from Paris Saint-Germain for the rest of the season. Felipe, a 33-year-old Brazilian central defender, arrived from Atletico and midfielder Jonjo Shelvey came from Newcastle.

During the first week of its release, Dunki garnered slightly over Rs 160 crore.

"KL Rahul shouldn‚Äôt be singled out for lack of runs, feels Gautam Gambhir","In his last 10 Test innings, Rahul has averaged a dismal 12.5 with not a single score of above 25. His sequence of scores read 8, 10, 12, 22, 23, 10, 2, 20, 17 and 1, raising questions about his place in the playing XI.","Former India opener Gautam Gambhir feels that it is a tad unfair to single out KL Rahul for scathing criticism as every player goes through lean phases in their respective careers.
In his last 10 Test innings, Rahul has averaged a dismal 12.5 with not a single score of above 25. His sequence of scores read 8, 10, 12, 22, 23, 10, 2, 20, 17 and 1, raising questions about his place in the playing XI.
There are strong calls to induct Shubman Gill in playing XI.
‚ÄúKL Rahul should not be dropped from the Indian side. One should not single out any player. Everyone goes through a lean patch. No one, no cricket pundit or anyone should tell him that he is not doing well and be dropped,‚Äù Gambhir told PTI during an interaction on the sidelines of IPL pre-season camp organised by Lucknow Super Giants.
Gambhir is the mentor of LSG and Rahul is the skipper of the same franchise.
The two-time IPL champion former captain of KKR also cited current India captain Rohit Sharma‚Äôs example of how he was backed to the hilt by the erstwhile team management so that he is successful in Test cricket. Once Rohit started opening, things looked up for him in traditional format.
‚ÄúYou have to back players who have talent. Look at Rohit Sharma. He also had a lean patch. Look at the way he started his career. He had a late flourish. Compared (earlier times) to how he is performing now. Everyone could see his talent and backed him. Now see the result. He is going great guns. Rahul can do the same,‚Äù Gammbhir seemed confident of his abilities.
ADVERTISEMENT
The southpaw is of the opinion that if the team is winning matches comfortably, there is no point in tinkering with winning combination and single out one player for harsh treatment.
‚ÄúIndia is 2-0 up and not 0-2 down. So let‚Äôs not axe anyone and appreciate the team‚Äôs performance. I think the Indian team management is right in backing KL Rahul. He is a great player. He had scored runs in international cricket.‚Äù On the Indian women‚Äôs team‚Äôs semi-final encounter against Australia in ICC T20 World Cup, Gambhir said: ‚ÄúI think India has got the talent to beat Australia. Obviously, Australia is a good team but I am sure the Indian women‚Äôs team has the potential to beat Australia. If you can play those 240 balls better than Australia, then the team can beat them.‚Äù While Indian women lost badly to England in a group league match, Gambhir feels that they have been consistent enough.
‚ÄúI think the Indian team has been very consistent the way they are playing this tournament. Now the occasions should not matter. You know people will talk about the semi-final. ultimately it is not the occasion, it is the contest of the bat and ball,‚Äù he added.

Answering a question in the Lok Sabha, on whether the government has conducted any study to understand the causes behind high dropout rates amongst OBC, SC, and ST students in these Higher Education Institutions, Sarkar said: ‚ÄúIn the Higher Education sector, students have multiple options and they choose to migrate across institutions and from one course/programme to another in the same institution. The migration/withdrawal if any, is mainly on account of securing seat by the students in other departments or institutions of their choice or on any personal ground.‚Äù

ICC Match Referee gives ‚Äòaverage‚Äô rating to Jamtha and Kotla tracks,"In Delhi, Australian batters couldn't adjust to the up and down nature of the track on the third day and lost last nine second innings wickets for 52 runs.","The ICC match referee has given ‚Äúaverage‚Äù rating to both pitches in Nagpur and Delhi, respectively, where India thrashed Australia inside three days to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
The ratings will be uploaded on the ICC website but PTI can confirm that match referee Andy Pycroft hasn‚Äôt given any adverse report about the two tracks.
While the Australian media went paranoid about the nature of the Nagpur track where the visitors scored 177 and 91 in both innings, India were able to score 400 in their only innings.
In Delhi, Australian batters couldn‚Äôt adjust to the up and down nature of the track on the third day and lost last nine second innings wickets for 52 runs.
While Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja ruled the roost during the two games, an ‚ÄúAverage‚Äù rating means that no demerit points are awarded to the venue.
There are six distinct classifications ‚Äî Very Good, Good, Average, Below Average, Poor and Unfit.

Ricky Gervais Armageddon review: Provocative comedian dusts off dated material in latest Netflix standup special,"Ricky Gervais Armageddon review: The British comedian certainly isn't breaking new ground with his latest Netflix standup special, but his penchant for provocation remains as cheeky as ever.","Is it even a joke if you have to explain it? But that‚Äôs what Ricky Gervais repeatedly does in his new Netflix special, Armageddon. Essentially a cover version of his greatest hits, the hourlong special finds the comedian taking particular delight in essentially committing an act of onstage arson. Gervais tackles everything from dying babies to dwarf actors, from China to chimpanzees. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll realise this is great satire when I‚Äôm dead,‚Äù he says at the end of a particularly hilarious bit about ordering a pair of track bottoms off Amazon.
His recurring schtick in Armageddon is to keep telling the audience that he‚Äôs still workshopping the material, implying that some of the jokes haven‚Äôt yet been perfected. It‚Äôs all a part of the act, of course, even the extended break-downs. The bigger question is, why? Why, after all these years, does Gervais feel the need to underline every point that he is making? The simplest answer is that, in his attempt to spell things out, he is satirising his audience‚Äôs dwindling appetite for risqu√© humour.

Australian Open 2023: Rybakina beats No. 1 Swiatek to reach quarterfinals,"Rybakina ‚Äî who will face Coco Gauff or Jelena Ostapenko for a berth in the semifinals ‚Äî was born in Moscow but has played for Kazakhstan since 2018, when that country offered her funding to support her tennis career.","Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina eliminated No. 1-ranked Iga Swiatek in straight sets Sunday to reach the Australian Open quarterfinals for the first time.
The 22nd-seeded Rybakina used her big serving to unsettle Swiatek and got the better of their baseline exchanges to win 6-4, 6-4 in about 1 1/2 hours.
‚ÄúI played well in the important moments,‚Äù said Rybakina, a 23-year-old who represents Kazakhstan. ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm nervous every time I go on the court, I think like everybody. But I‚Äôm calm, always. At least I‚Äôm trying not to show too much emotions. My coach says I actually need to show sometimes, so I‚Äôm also learning.‚Äù
Swiatek is a three-time major champion, including titles at the French Open and U.S. Open last season.
Rybakina‚Äôs ranking of No. 25 does not properly reflect her ability or results because her championship at the All England Club last July did not come with any ranking points. The WTA and ATP tours withheld all points at Wimbledon in 2022 after the All England Club barred players from Russia and Belarus from participating because of the invasion of Ukraine.

Rybakina ‚Äî who will face Coco Gauff or Jelena Ostapenko for a berth in the semifinals ‚Äî was born in Moscow but has played for Kazakhstan since 2018, when that country offered her funding to support her tennis career.
Despite her status as a major champion, Rybakina has been out of the spotlight: Her first-round match at Melbourne Park was placed on tiny Court 13 last Monday; her match against two-time Slam champ Garbi√±e Muguruza at least year‚Äôs U.S. Open was on Court 4.

But her game is worthy of much more attention, as she displayed in knocking out Swiatek at Rod Laver Arena.
Rybakina hit six aces and compiled a 24-15 edge in winners against the 21-year-old from Poland, who was a semifinalist a year ago in Australia. That followed Rybakina‚Äôs victory over 2022 runner-up Danielle Collins in the third round.

Until Sunday, Swiatek had looked fairly dominant, winning every set she contested and dropping a total of just 15 games through three matches.
She was not at her best this time, and Rybakina had a lot to do with that. In the opening game, Swiatek led 40-love but got broken. In the next, Swiatek held two break points at 15-40 but failed to convert either. So early on, while it ended up being 2-2, it very well could have been 4-0 in Swiatek‚Äôs favor.
ADVERTISEMENT
Rybakina wound up serving out that set at love, capping it with a 113 mph (183 kph) ace, and her dangerous backhand was quite a help, too: She produced six winners off that wing in the first set, compared with zero for Swiatek.
In the second set, Swiatek appeared to have gotten herself back on track, looking very much like the player who put together a 37-match winning streak last year. But that surge didn‚Äôt last long, and Rybakina took six of the match‚Äôs last seven games.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/australian-open-2023-rybakina-beats-no-1-swiatek-to-reach-quarterfinals-8396790/,sports
"Handling of Ishan Kishan situation, persisting with Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli shows up Indian cricket as crusty, conservative and outdated",Ishan Kishan asking for a break because of mental fatigue should never have been pushed into a corner by the team's decision makers.,"After warming the bench for most of last year, Ishan Kishan asked for a break in December, during the South Africa tour. He is said to have told the team management that he was mentally fatigued and missing home. In the days to follow, he would be seen on Kaun Banega Crorepati talking about his tattoo, cracking jokes and regaling the crowd with Team India stories. Later, pictures of him in Dubai would emerge. These were usual frames that the young put out to tell the world that they were having a good time. One had him on the balcony of a skyscraper with a bay full of yachts below, another had him at a fine dining restaurant. So far so good.
But this didn‚Äôt go down well with the righteous decision-makers of Indian cricket. The 25-year-old wicketkeeper from Jharkhand, scorer of two half-centuries in three T20Is against Australia at No.3, a certified white-ball dasher with an ODI double hundred to his name as an opener, was mysteriously dropped for the Afghanistan series. He was not even picked for the Tests. Dhruv Jurel too was higher in the pecking order now. Also missing from the T20 squad was Shreyas Iyer, the find for India in the ODI World Cup.
Taking Ishan‚Äôs place in the T20I squad were a couple of lower-order wicketkeepers ‚Äì Sanju Samson and Jitesh Sharma. They were the designated finishers, the high-pressure operators, chasers of impossible targets. Meanwhile, the position in the team where Ishan bats in white-ball cricket was now to be occupied by the old owners. Back in the team were two stalwarts in their mid-30s ‚Äì Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.
The selectors were making a statement ‚Äì the veterans of many failed ICC events were once again the designated Top 3 batsmen for the T20 World Cup in June. Was it the right move? Not really.
Both Virat and Rohit are known to be the anchors ‚Äì an ODI cricket concept that is on the verge of extinction in T20s. In this day and age, having even one ODI native in a T20 playing XI is considered a luxury. India, oblivious of the changing dynamics of T20 cricket, was indulging two of them. Both might have enjoyed spectacular individual success at these world events but India under their watch haven‚Äôt won an ICC trophy for more than a decade. Even in IPL, they don‚Äôt have the numbers that give them the aura of match-winner batsmen. They are brands, they are seen as leaders, but not your every-day game-changers.
Also Read | India vs Afghanistan: Was it mistrust that resulted in the dropping of Ishan Kishan?
Were the selectors being conservative or were they reluctant to take the tough unpopular calls that could potentially trigger waves of social media attacks by troll armies of the dropped megastars? Since the good old tradition of national selectors facing the media after every meeting has for long been dumped, the rationale behind these decisions would forever remain a state secret.

‚Äî Ishan Kishan (@ishankishan51) January 12, 2024
Days later, head coach Rahul Dravid, before the first game of the Afghanistan series, would further complicate the Ishan matter. ‚ÄúIshan Kishan was not available for selection. He requested for a break in South Africa which we agreed to. He has not made himself available for selection and when he does, I am sure he‚Äôll play domestic cricket and make himself available for selection,‚Äù he said.
Unequal treatment
Those tuned in to Indian cricket long enough know what ‚Äúhe‚Äôll play domestic cricket and make himself available‚Äù means. It‚Äôs a euphemism for a rap on the knuckle. It‚Äôs the classic class teacher‚Äôs ‚Äògo stand in the corner‚Äô snub. Worryingly, it can also be the proverbial push over the cliff into the abyss that has thousands of hopefuls trying to crawl up.
ADVERTISEMENT
There was a counter-question that Dravid needed to be asked. With the five-Test series against England round the corner, a vital outing keeping in mind the World Test Championship calculations, aren‚Äôt Sharma and Kohli better off playing a Ranji game than a T20 series against Afghanistan?
One of the decision-makers, when asked about the Ishan situation, fished out that good old cliche. ‚ÄúIshan remains in the scheme of things,‚Äù he would say.
It‚Äôs that stale carrot that gets historically dangled in front of all horses ‚Äì those genuinely in race and also the ones practically out of it.
Also Read | Tests vs England: Ishan Kishan overlooked, Dhruv Jurel called up as India announce four-prong spin attack
But what exactly is this ‚Äúscheme‚Äù? It‚Äôs the same that the selectors have stuck with for years now. By including Rohit and Virat for the Afghanistan series, the selectors were making it clear that transition will have to wait. As has been India‚Äôs good old tradition of giving an unendingly long rope to seniors, the bold decision seems to have been pushed back. In Indian cricket, the barn door gets slammed only after the horses have bolted.
ADVERTISEMENT
Only once, before the 2007 World T20, India took the courageous call of trusting a bunch of promising youngsters and a fresh leadership approach. But MS Dhoni‚Äôs historic win, with a team without Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Dravid, is considered an exception, a miracle that just happened. The success of that leap of faith didn‚Äôt inspire subsequent selection committees. They continued to take those mini hop-scotch jumps without going anywhere.
To be a true world leader, India‚Äôs decision-makers need to keep pace with the ever-evolving cricket, and more importantly the cricketers. Those in the know say that the Indian team management was insensitive to the frustration that Ishan faced while being benched for a long time. Mental fatigue is a Western concept, and we, the relentless toilers, never face such frivolous trauma ‚Äì was the thought process.
Ishan was also blamed for not taking his non-selection in the right spirit. The leadership wants the Ishans of the world to be grinning widely, running enthusiastically with drinks while waiting on the fringes. Even when the seniors get undeserving extensions, the juniors shouldn‚Äôt sulk but do joyous cartwheels for the sake of the team. They shouldn‚Äôt even take a break from the game and post happy pictures from Dubai. That‚Äôs not what good juniors do, feel India‚Äôs decision-makers. Ok boomer.

YouTube ditches angular corners for rounded ones in new design upgrade,"Although new design has been deployed, it is being rolled out in a phased manner.","Google is known to make frequent changes to its apps and services, mostly considering their aesthetic and utilitarian aspects. Latest in the new wave of change is the rounded corners in YouTube‚Äôs video player. In a bid to make the application visually appealing, YouTube has ditched its angular edges for curved ones.
With the latest update, the main video player now looks similar to the mini player and video suggestion on the left panel. Contrary to the sharp edges of the earlier version, the new rounded edge is expected to offer a softer look and a modern feel. The new look will not be applicable to the theatre mode. When a user maximises the video, it will likely fill out the entire screen.
The latest development has been confirmed by YouTube spokesperson Allison Toh to The Verge. Toh said that all users will see the rounded corners in videos on the desktop site.

The new look is not all about visual appeal, as it has some visible drawbacks. Reportedly, YouTube is cutting down on pixels from the original content, in essence, the platform is showing cropped videos. Moreover, design experts feel that rounded corners may not go well with desktop monitors that come with squared-off corners. Several users took to Twitter to express their displeasure with the new change.

SEBI chief urges investors to take long-term view of markets to beat inflation rate,"SEBI‚Äôs study, released in January this year, stated that 90 per cent of the active traders incurred average losses of Rs 1.25 lakh during FY22.","SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Monday urged investors to invest on a long-term basis as it would help in wealth creation, beat inflation and provide real rate of returns.
Referring to the Securities and Exchange Board of India‚Äôs (SEBI) recent study, which showed that around 89 per cent of the individual traders in the equity Futures and options (F&O) segment incurred losses with an average loss of Rs 1.1 lakh during FY 2021-2022 (FY22), Buch said she was confused and surprised as to why people continue to trade in the segment knowing that the odds are not in their favour at all.
‚ÄúThere is a 90 per cent chance that the investor will lose money in the F&O segment. But we also know and the data shows us that, if you take a long-term view of the market and if you invest with a long term perspective, you will rarely go wrong,‚Äù she said at the launch of an Investor Risk Reduction Access (IRRA) platform.

F&O are derivative instruments where traders buy an underlying asset (share) at a predetermined price.
SEBI‚Äôs study, released in January this year, stated that 90 per cent of the active traders incurred average losses of Rs 1.25 lakh during FY22.
For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), on an average, loss makers registered net trading loss close to Rs 50,000 in FY22. For the group of active traders (excluding outliers), the average loss of a loss maker was over 15 times the average profit by a profit maker during FY22, the study showed. Buch said the real power lies in the hands of the investors if they take a longer-term view on their investments.
If investors take a long-term view, there is really a good chance that they would be creating wealth for themselves and their family over a sustained period of time that would ‚Äúexceed the inflation rate in the economy‚Äù, and therefore, they would actually get ‚Äúreal rate of return on their investments over the long-term‚Äù, she said.

At the end of September 2023, 3.35 crore demat accounts were registered with National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) and 9.62 crore with Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL), as per the SEBI‚Äôs October bulletin.
IRRA platform, which was launched by Buch, is conceptualised and implemented by market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) under the guidance of SEBI to reduce risks faced by investors in the eventuality of technical glitch at trading member end at both primary site and disaster recovery site.
It provides investors an opportunity to square off or cancel their pending orders in case of a disruption of trading services provided by trading members.
ADVERTISEMENT
Buch said the IRRA platform is a safety net that will help people to invest with confidence.
‚ÄúThe hope is that this is a system that we will never need to use. It‚Äôs like a safety net which is there for a trapeze artist‚Ä¶he hopes to never use that safety net but it really needs to be there,‚Äù she said.
IRRA can be invoked by trading members when they are faced with a technical glitch at their end impacting their ability to service clients across exchanges from both ‚Äì primary site and disaster recovery site, where relevant.
On invocation, after basic checks, the platform downloads trades of trading members from all the trading venues and sends SMS/email to investors using internet trading or wireless technology along with a link to access IRRA. Investors using this link can review the status of their investment, orders etc, and place orders for squaring off or closing positions.
Speaking on the upstreaming of clients funds by stock brokers (SBs)/ clearing members (CMs) to clearing corporations (CCs), the chairperson said though it was implemented, the regulator has received feedback about difficulty in complying with the guidelines.
As per the framework, SBs/CMs cannot retain clients‚Äô funds on an end of day (EoD) basis. The clients‚Äô funds has to be upstreamed by SB/ CMs to CCs only in the form of either cash, lien on fixed deposit receipts (FDR), or pledge of units of Mutual Fund Overnight Schemes (MFOS).

Buch said the regulator, after taking feedback from brokers, will be soon issuing a new notification on the upstreaming of funds.
‚ÄúThe operational challenges that were faced by our brokers in terms of the upstreaming circular are now pretty much resolved, and hopefully we should have a notification which now simplifies everybody‚Äôs life quite considerably,‚Äù she said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/sebi-chief-urges-investors-to-take-long-term-view-of-markets-to-beat-inflation-rate-9035386/,business

"Nahi khelna hain toh jaayein, humein kya hain? We are not interested: Javed Miandad clarifies his ‚ÄòIndia can go to hell‚Äô comment","Following the Asian Cricket Council week last meet, the BCCI made their stand clear on the Indian team not travelling to Pakistan to play the upcoming Asia Cup.","Asked about his recent comment of ‚ÄúIndia can go to hell‚Äù while talking about the Board of Control for Cricket in India‚Äôs (BCCI) rigid stance on not touring Pakistan for the 2023 Asia Cup, Pakistan legend Javed Miandad clarified his comment on Wednesday.
‚ÄúDo you know what hell means? If you don‚Äôt want to play just don‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt have a problem. Ask the Indian cricketers. They‚Äôll also say that there should be cricket between these two teams in their respective countries. It‚Äôll benefit both nations,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúIf they think that their (India) not coming to Pakistan makes any difference, let me tell you that it doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what I meant. We are independent. Pakistan has produced world class cricketers as well as hockey players. Everywhere around the world, neighbour countries are playing with each other,‚Äù he added.
Talking about previous encounters between India and Pakistan when the tension between the countries were at the wane, he said, ‚ÄúEarlier we used to go there and then they used to come here. When India came to play a series in Pakistan, there were so many people from India who also came to watch. There were no hotels available and the Lahore residents invited them to their houses. It had a very good impact on the relationships between the two countries.‚Äù
Asked what his reaction was to the Indian media talking about his comments, he said, ‚ÄúThe media there is like this only. The competition there is very high. They even write so many things about the Indian players only and I am left surprised by them. This is not done. You should take comments in a positive way. Our press don‚Äôt react that way to Indian players. What I meant with my comment was if you are not playing, go. (Nahi khelna hain toh jaayein, humein kya hain?) Doesn‚Äôt make a difference to us. We are not interested.‚Äù
‚ÄúI just want that the neighbours maintain a good relationship. There are so many Pakistani citizens who have their relatives in India and vice versa. In Pakistan, we don‚Äôt discriminate on basis of religion. When there are Hindu festivals, they are given full facilities. There are also mandirs here. What I meant by my comment was if yopu are not playing, what should we do? It‚Äôs not like if India play, we‚Äôll get something out of it. I am just saying, there‚Äôll be a good relationship between the two countries,‚Äù he added.
‚ÄúI went and met Bal Thackeray in his house. He was so nice to me. I did 9 programmes, even on the roads. Everything went by without a glitch. There are some people in India twist things. But if you take the Indian masses, they are not like this only. My comment was also twisted. They didn‚Äôt understand what I meant. I said it in a positive way,‚Äù he said before signing off.

"Specify steps taken for providing non-discriminatory, enabling environment to ST, SC category students: Supreme Court to UGC","The petitioners also sought directions to the Centre and the UGC to ensure that all universities, including deemed universities and higher educational institutions, comply with UGC equity regulations in ""letter and in spirit"".","University Grants Commissions (UGC) has been asked by the Supreme Court to specify the steps it has taken and has proposed to take to provide non-discriminatory and enabling environment for students belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes categories in institutions of higher learning. The apex court termed it as a ‚Äúvery serious issue.‚Äù
A bench of Justices AS Bopanna and MM Sundresh asked the UGC to furnish the details of steps taken on a plea by the mothers of Rohith Vemula and Payal Tadvi, who had allegedly died by suicide following alleged caste-based discrimination in their educational institutions.
While Vemula, a dalit PhD scholar at Hyderabad Central University, had ended his life on January 17, 2016, Tadvi, a tribal student at TN Topiwala National Medical College, Mumbai, took the extreme step on May 22, 2019 due to alleged caste-based discrimination by three doctors of her institution.
‚ÄúThis is a very serious issue. Whatever concerns are raised‚Ä¶ how do you propose to deal with it and what steps have you taken to address these grievances? This issue is non-adversarial and the UGC needs to take some concrete action. It is for the benefit of students and their parents. Steps taken would ensure that these types of incidents don‚Äôt happen in future,‚Äù the bench told the counsel appearing for the UGC.
Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for the mothers of Vemula and Tadvi, said they have lost their son and daughter respectively, and in the past one year three more students studying at a National Law School, a medical college and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay have taken their lives.

‚ÄúTherefore, there is a sense of urgency about this petition. It would be appropriate that UGC formulates binding guidelines which can be followed by institutes of higher learning.
‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that the existing guidelines do not have a binding effect as they do not have any sanction for violation of the norms. There should be some regulations like Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) at Workplace Act and the anti-ragging law, which provides for punitive action in case of violation‚Äù, Jaising said.

She said equity regulations framed by the UGC in 2012 to address the complaints of caste discrimination on campuses are proving to be inadequate.
The counsel for UGC said the Commission is aware of the situation and has written to vice-chancellors of universities and college principals.
Justice Sundresh told the counsel that efforts needed to be made so the students from SC/ST communities are main-streamed.
‚ÄúYou need to ensure that there is no discrimination as some of them may drop out of the college/universities, if they don‚Äôt get along with other students. For this, some out of the box solutions are needed,‚Äù he said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The bench then asked the UGC counsel to elicit suggestions from the petitioners and file a reply specifying the steps it has taken and proposed to take to create a non-discriminatory environment on campuses within four weeks.
On September 20, 2019, the top court had issued notice on the plea by the mothers of Vemula and Tadvi, seeking to end caste bias in universities and other higher education institutions across the country. It had sought responses from the Centre and the UGC on the petition.
The petitioners have sought enforcement of fundamental rights, particularly the right to equality, right to prohibition of discrimination against caste, and the right to life.
The petition has claimed rampant prevalence of caste-based discrimination in higher educational institutions throughout the country and said it reflects flagrant non-compliance with existing norms and regulations.
ADVERTISEMENT
It hasfurther said these incidents are violative of the fundamental rights to equality, equal opportunity, right against discrimination, abolition of untouchability, and right to life guaranteed under Article 14, 15, 16, 17 and 21 of the Constitution.
The petitioners have sought directions to the Centre and the UGC to strictly ensure enforcement of and compliance with the UGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2012, popularly called ‚ÄòUGC equity regulations‚Äô. They have also sought directions to the Centre and the UGC to ensure that all universities, including deemed universities and higher educational institutions, comply with UGC equity regulations in ‚Äúletter and in spirit‚Äù.
The plea has sought court‚Äôs direction to ensure that all universities and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) establish Equal Opportunity Cells and such other anti-discrimination internal complaint mechanisms, and to include members from SC/ST communities and independent representatives from NGOs or social activists to ensure objectivity and impartiality in the process.
It has also sought direction to all universities to take strong disciplinary action against victimisation of students or staff who file complaints alleging caste-based discrimination, and to take necessary steps in the nature of interim reliefs that restrain the HEI from creating a hostile environment against students who file such complaints.
ADVERTISEMENT
Besides these directions, the petition has sought various steps to ensure an end to caste-based discrimination on campuses.
‚ÄúSince 2004, there have been over 20 documented instances of students committing suicides across the universities in the country. Various committees set up to look into these deaths have concluded that SC, ST students have faced systematic discrimination in matters of allotting supervisors, caste-based abuses, problems in matters of scholarships, and more,‚Äù the plea has said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/specify-steps-taken-for-providing-non-discriminatory-enabling-environment-to-sc-st-category-students-sc-to-ugc-8788926/,education
"Jailer director Nelson Dilipkumar was advised not to make Rajinikanth play his age, fight choreographer was unhappy about certain decisions","Director Nelson Dilipkumar was questioned for the creative choices he made while staging certain scenes in Jailer, and was also advised to let Rajinikanth do what he does best instead of experimenting.","Filmmaker Nelson Dilipkumar‚Äôs Jailer, starring superstar Rajinikanth, emerged as a global hit upon its release in August this year. But before commencing work on the film and even during production, Nelson had significant doubts about how he would project Rajinikanth on the big screen. His creative choices were questioned by members of his own crew, and he was advised to let Rajinikanth do what he does best and not experiment.
In a new interview, Nelson shared how he stuck to his guns and didn‚Äôt allow anyone to muddle his vision. He shared with Film Companion that he always wanted to make a film with Rajinikanth. Once the script was completed, Nelson had doubts even during the shoot. He shared, ‚ÄúThis is the first time I made him play his age, that was the major doubt in me because people told me, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt make him play his age. Let him do whatever he has done already. Don‚Äôt grey his hair.‚Äô But I was like, even if it has to fail, let it be with my gut, I will take the blame. I didn‚Äôt want someone to confuse me.‚Äù

The filmmaker revealed that the pre-interval action sequence of the movie took him a month to write. In the sequence, Rajinikanth is seen sitting at a dining table with his wife and daughter-in-law and a dead body falls on them. ‚ÄúI thought about staging that scene for a month. I wanted Rajini sir to be cool in that whole film. Rather than him fighting, whatever happens around him should be more interesting and never seen before in his films. I myself wrote the whole stunt and scripted the whole scene,‚Äù shared Nelson.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, on the day of the shoot, the fight choreographer asked Nelson, ‚ÄúIs it okay that Rajini sir is not doing anything?‚Äù Not just him, ‚ÄúMany people asked if Rajini sir (should be given something to do) at least. These decisions were a little difficult for me, but I liked the staging of that situation.‚Äù Nelson went with his gut and ended up delivering a massive hit.

IND vs AUS: Nagpur pitch ‚Äútricked‚Äù us: Handscomb,Ravindra Jadeja (5/47) and Ravichandran Ashwin (3/42) shared eight wickets between them as Australia were bowled out for 177 in their first innings. Many Australian batters were out playing poor shots. Some of them played for the turn when there was none.,"Australia batter Peter Handscomb on Thursday admitted that the Nagpur track ‚Äútricked‚Äù the visiting side as it did a lot less than what they had feared in the opening Test of the four-match series.
Ravindra Jadeja (5/47) and Ravichandran Ashwin (3/42) shared eight wickets between them as Australia were bowled out for 177 in their first innings. Many Australian batters were out playing poor shots. Some of them played for the turn when there was none.
India reached 77 for 1 at stumps on the opening day.
‚ÄúIt definitely wasn‚Äôt easy out there. It‚Äôs tough because when the pitch is playing tricks that starts to play with your mind a little bit as well,‚Äù Handscomb said at the press conference after the opening day‚Äôs play.
‚ÄúThe ball that doesn‚Äôt do as much you expect to do a little bit more and that‚Äôs where you can come undone with the ball that goes straight on, rather than the big turners we saw out there as well.‚Äù Handscomb, who scored 31 in the Australian innings, said the Indian team bowled really well as a unit and didn‚Äôt give away easy runs.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough out there, Jadeja was obviously bowling very well, not really giving our batsmen a lot to hit and I found him tough to score (against),‚Äù the 31-year-old right- handed batter said.
For Handscomb, it was a comeback to the Test team after four years and he said he was feeling nice to play again in the longest format.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked really hard on a lot of things on my game, mentally, tactically and on my technique as well.

Beneath Rajinikanth‚Äôs ‚ÄòStyle Mannan‚Äô persona lies a powerful performer,"Ace director J Mahendran, often regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of Tamil cinema, astutely recognised and brought forth Rajinikanth's untapped acting abilities in the three films they collaborated on as director and actor.","‚ÄúThalaivar,‚Äù ‚ÄúSuperstar,‚Äù ‚ÄúStyle Mannan,‚Äù et al, are sobriquets that have long adorned Rajinikanth‚Äôs name. With an impressive knack for captivating audiences through his swag, style, charm and ability to connect with the average viewer, Rajinikanth, who turns 73 on Tuesday (December 12), has dominated Tamil cinema for over four decades. Yet, the label of a ‚Äúbrilliant actor‚Äù has seldom been attributed to him, and rightfully so. Given the abundance of acting prowess among Indian cinema stars, Rajinikanth, while a decent actor, never took on or received roles that showcased his performance abilities and he, instead, focused on appealing to audiences eager to witness the Rajinikanth they wish to see on-screen.
However, it can never be said that Rajinikanth is a poor actor. In fact, to continue enthralling audiences all these years requires talent that he has consistently exhibited. Even in his first movie, Apoorva Raagangal (1975), helmed by K Balachander, there were initial glimpses of his acting potential.

Watch this space: Humans want to go to the Moon again and never leave,NASA is back with the Artemis programme to put humanity back on the Moon.,"NASA had initially planned for the Artemis 3 mission to land humans on the Moon in 2025, around 52 years after the last Apollo mission landed astronauts in 1952. But now, the United States Government Accountability Office says the space agency will not be able to do that until 2027 at the earliest. But why does NASA want to send astronauts to the Moon again when it has already proven that it can do that more than half a century ago? 
If you share that sentiment, you are not in poor company. Former American president Barack Obama felt the same. During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in 2010, he turned NASA‚Äôs attention away from the Moon and towards Mars and deep space asteroids. ‚ÄúI just have to say pretty bluntly here: We‚Äôve been there before. There‚Äôs a lot more of space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.‚Äù

The director, 85, whose long career includes hit films such as Thelma & Louise, Alien and The Martian, said his production team was dedicated to making the historical epic look accurate.

"For initiative combating pandemic-induced learning disruption, MCD school on T4‚Äôs education‚Äôs shortlist for ‚Äòworld‚Äôs best school for community collaboration‚Äô",The programme was designed to equip family members to help and guide students; 64 dropouts enrolled back.,"‚Äî Ishita Roy
The Nagar Nigam Pratibha Baalika Vidyalaya in North East Delhi‚Äôs Dilshad Colony, run by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), has made it to UK-based T4 Education‚Äôs top 10 shortlist on the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Schools in Community Collaboration‚Äù.
The news was announced by the organisation, which puts out a list every year on ‚Äúschools that have made a difference‚Äù, in June.
The school, which was established in 1965, started a community engagement programme in April 2020, one month into the national lockdown imposed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Called the Family Champion Programme, the initiative aimed at ensuring that students stayed connected with the school, even as physical and in-person education took a hit during the pandemic.
Read | Delhi schools bordering Yamuna to remain closed today
The school worked with an NGO named Kshamtalaya Foundation for the same, which reached out to the students and their families through a door-to-door campaign. The aim: equipping family members to help and guide their children with classes by briefing them about the challenges of virtual education.
‚ÄúWe all know that kids from economically backward communities come to the MCD schools. So, it was our responsibility to give them quality education at all times. They should also know everything, education should reach everyone,‚Äù said Principal Sita Verma.
Verma said the school also started 25 community libraries and a dry ration distribution programme.

‚ÄúThe libraries were set up in very cramped and small spaces, where our volunteers would carry out educational activities. Despite the challenges, we made sure that they kept running. Some of these spaces were part of homes of volunteers and former students,‚Äù said Verma.
Due to the school‚Äôs continuous efforts in ‚Äúcommunity-based interventions‚Äù, 65 dropouts were enrolled in the school across its morning and evening schedules.
‚ÄúWe were determined to enrol students who dropped out of schools during Covid-19,‚Äù said Jyoti Yadav, Community Lead, Kshamtalaya Foundation.
‚ÄúWe never thought that our efforts would win us international recognition. We did this for our kids. I was a teacher before I became a principal. For me, it was always about making education accessible,‚Äù said Verma.
ADVERTISEMENT
She said that only 16 family members, who the programme called Family Champions, completed the training offered through the initiative in 2020. However, the number rose up of 20 and 25 in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Asked about the plans ahead, Verma said the school was looking at expanding the initiative further.
‚ÄúWe have seen many women who want to be part of the programme. They are doing this for the children but also for themselves. Our programme also helped these women, who have been in the household for so long, to get back their confidence. They not only taught but also trained other family champions,‚Äù said Verma.
Sangam Kumari, one of the mothers engaged in the programme, told The Indian Express, ‚ÄúLearning the art of teaching has changed my life. I am more confident now. Earlier, I did not dare to speak against my husband, but now I can also stand up for myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe started this programme keeping in mind the guidelines of the NEP (National Education Policy), 2020. The goals of our programme are community education and women‚Äôs participation,‚Äù said Aggarwal.
‚ÄúT4 Education is a UK-based organisation, very reputed in education. We got to know that they award schools for their efforts in making a difference in the education sector. When we were starting our programme, we realised that no other school has done anything like this. This motivated us to keep doing what we did,‚Äù added Aggarwal.
T4 Education told The Indian Express that 10 schools were selected out of the applications received from 108 countries.
The top three finalists will be declared by September, while the winner will be announced in October, informed T4 Education.

‚ÄòCan‚Äôt change Govt order on Hijab just like that‚Äô: Karnataka Minister Madhu Bangarappa,"The Supreme Court delivered a split judgment in October 2022, the matter has now been referred to a three-judge bench.","Amidst an ongoing legal battle regarding the validity of wearing hijab in educational institutions in Karnataka, the newly appointed School Education Minister, Madhu Bangarappa, has stated that the Congress government cannot immediately change the government order that bans hijab in classes. The Congress government had promised to lift restrictions on hijab as part of its electoral campaign in Karnataka.
In February 2022, the BJP government in Karnataka issued an order mandating uniforms prescribed by the government or private institution managements for students in schools and pre-university colleges across the state, following the hijab controversy. In March 2022, the Karnataka High Court dismissed petitions filed by a group of Muslim students who sought permission to wear hijab inside classrooms.

The law department will handle the matter and make a decision. For years, everything was functioning smoothly. Imposing a sudden ban on hijab was unnecessary. The BJP politicised the issue, creating complications. Since the matter is sub judice, I prefer not to comment further.‚Äù
Earlier, speaking to this newspaper, Priyank Kharge, Bangarappa‚Äôs colleague in the cabinet, had also said that the Congress government will have to study the ‚Äúlegal aspects‚Äù before committing to overturn the hijab order since the matter is subjudice. ‚ÄúWe will look into the legal aspect of it (hijab issue) and take a call. There is data to show that nearly 18,000 students are left out of schools because of a certain order. If the judiciary gets into legislation, what should legislators do then? If our legislation is bad, let the courts intervene. Any executive order, bill or ordinance that is regressive will be reviewed to get Karnataka back on track,‚Äù Kharge has said.

The Karnataka High Court, comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, Justice Krishna S Dixit, and Justice J M Khazi, upheld the government order, stating that prescribing school uniforms is a reasonable restriction and constitutionally permissible, to which students cannot object. However, the petitioners approached the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court‚Äôs decision and seeking the dismissal of the Karnataka government order banning hijab in classrooms.

The Supreme Court delivered a split judgment in October 2022. Justice Hemant Gupta upheld the Karnataka High Court order, validating the ban and stating that it promotes uniformity and encourages a secular environment in classrooms. On the other hand, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia set aside the state and High Court orders, emphasizing that the right to wear hijab in classrooms is a matter of choice and a fundamental right linked to the girl‚Äôs dignity and privacy, even within school premises.
Following the Supreme Court‚Äôs split verdict, the matter has now been referred to a three-judge bench.

The hijab controversy emerged in December 2021 when six female students from Government PU College in Udupi claimed they were not permitted to attend classes while wearing hijabs. This sparked protests that spread to other districts, resulting in the state issuing an order for students to adhere to prescribed uniforms in PUC (Class 11 and 12) and degree colleges.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cant-change-govt-order-on-hijab-just-like-that-karnataka-education-minister-8639188/,education

Google‚Äôs court loss to Epic Games may cost billions but final outcome years away,"A jury in California found on Monday that the Alphabet-owned company's Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, quashing competition and charging app developers unduly high fees of up to 30%.","Google‚Äôs stunning defeat in a legal battle with ‚ÄúFortnite‚Äù maker Epic Games may clear the way for rival app stores on its Android mobile system but a lengthy appeals process will likely prevent any changes for years, according to analysts and legal experts.
A jury in California found on Monday that the Alphabet-owned company‚Äôs Play app store operated as an illegal monopoly, quashing competition and charging app developers unduly high fees of up to 30%.
Epic Games will now have a chance to submit a court filing on how it wants Google‚Äôs Play Store to be fixed ‚Äî potentially putting at risk what Wells Fargo estimates is $10 billion in annual revenue from app sales and in-app purchases for the tech giant.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThis is a big win for Epic,‚Äù said Pinar Akman, professor of competition law at the University of Leeds.
‚ÄúThe usual remedy in such case ‚Ä¶ would mean Google may be required to allow developers to use payment systems other than Google‚Äôs. If such a remedy is adopted, then that will have an impact on the entire ecosystem and business model.‚Äù
Google takes a cut on each digital purchase through Play Store on Android, the mobile system it develops. While revenue from such transactions is a fraction of the total sales, it‚Äôs a high-margin business for the company, according to analysts.
The remedies could force it to allow rival app stores or lower the fees it charges on app sales and in-app purchases.
Alphabet shares were down nearly 1% on Tuesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
The unanimous ruling by the jury will intensify pressure on Google at a time it is caught in a legal battle with the U.S. Justice Department (DoJ), which has accused the online search leader of breaking antitrust law to stay on top.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth noting the ad tech case is also a jury trial. Ad tech is more complicated than app stores, but DOJ still must be feeling encouraged by last night‚Äôs jury ruling,‚Äù analysts at TD Cowen said.
The decision is also expected to deepen questions over Apple‚Äôs market dominance. The company won a similar fight against Epic but both the companies have approached the Supreme Court to review their dispute.
While it may not directly impact the case, the Google ruling will amplify questions about the influence Apple exerts through its App Store, said Eleanor Fox, professor emerita at the New York University School of Law.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúApple might be and should be more concerned that it will be found to be a monopoly,‚Äù Fox said.
LENGTHY APPEALS PROCESS
Google has said it will appeal the verdict, and the case will head to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That is the same court that heard Epic‚Äôs arguments last year to revive its antitrust claims against Apple.
In January, U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco will weigh Epic‚Äôs request for an injunction. Epic and Google will face off for a second time in court ‚Äî before the judge only.
Google would likely argue that the proposed injunction is too broad and needs to be more tailored.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so much will there be an injunction but the strength and scope of that remedy,‚Äù said antitrust legal scholar Christine Bartholomew of the University at Buffalo School of Law in New York.
Still, analysts expect Google to appeal any remedy orders from Judge Donato, delaying any potential changes.
‚ÄúUsing the timeline in Epic v. Apple as a guide, the 9th Circuit would likely rule around Q2 2025,‚Äù TD Cowen said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/googles-court-loss-to-epic-games-may-cost-billions-but-final-outcome-years-away-9065950/,technology

Pardon the leap of faith but Shubman Gill reminds one of a young Roger Federer,"Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma need to prefer in-form Shubman Gill over KL Rahul for the Gavaskar-Border Trophy. If they are in any doubt, they need to remember what West Zone selector Naren Tamhane said when the selection committee faced a dilemma over the 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar. ""Gentlemen, Sachin never fails,"" he had said.","In February of 2001, a few old hands reported from Basel, Switzerland that they had seen the future of tennis. They weren‚Äôt wrong. This February, there were many at the world‚Äôs biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad who too were sure that they had seen the future of Indian cricket.
Time will decide the authenticity of these latest claims but the optimism of those who saw a young Roger Federer back then and the ones watching Shubman Gill now, isn‚Äôt too different. There‚Äôs more to this audacious comparison.
Not a hair out of place, no sweat beads on forehead, tall graceful frame, measured footwork, refined technique, silken shots ‚Äì pardon the leap of faith, apologies for this wishful thinking ‚Äì but Shubman, 23, the other day, brought to mind the 20-something Federer.
It was at Basel, at the start of this century and four months before he beat Pete Sampras at Wimbledon to be the globally recognised King-in-waiting, that Federer had made a first big impression on a few American tennis writers ‚Äì the bunch of well-travelled hacks whose word carries weight and judgement is respected around the world.
Among those who had covered Federer‚Äôs single-handed Davis Cup demolition of Team USA was Christopher Clarey ‚Äì the seasoned New York Times tennis correspondent, whose present day Twitter bio-data goes thus ‚Äì 100+ Slams. 70+ countries. 15 Olympics.
At 41 years of age, Federer had gone far beyond when tennis players are expected to be relevant in the draws of big tournaments.(Reuters)
In his riveting book on Federer, titled The Master, Clarey has reproduced the more than two-decade-old match report he wrote after watching the 21-year-old Swiss star. With the delight of an early-riser who had caught the spectacular sun-rise, he wrote about Federer‚Äôs ‚Äúprecociously poised‚Äù, how he was ‚Äúinnately capable of raising his level under pressure‚Äù and his magical art that allowed him ‚Äúto do just about everything fluidly.‚Äù
If by some quirk of fate, the seasoned American tennis reporter had also covered the ancient British sport and had landed in Ahmedabad for the India-New Zealand T20 game, he could easily borrow a lot of lines from his insightful 2001 ode to the young Federer while describing Shubman‚Äôs unbeaten 126 from 63 balls. Those 12 fours and 7 sixes, on a different sporting arena of smaller dimension, divided by a net, would have been aces and winners.

Maybe, having seen many false dawns in his long career, Clarey, in his laudatory piece, adds a note of caution. In hindsight, it could have been edited out. However, at this stage of Shubman‚Äôs young career, it would be wise to retain that entire paragraph. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ It is impossible to know whether he will use his manifold gifts to become a consistent world-beater. Money, adulation and injuries can dull the biggest appetites and sharpest strokes, but there can be no doubt after the last two weeks that the Swiss have another potential champion in their midst,‚Äù he wrote, referring to another World No.1 and Federer‚Äôs country woman Martina Hingis.
As of now, there is no doubt about Shubman‚Äôs voracious appetite and sharpness of his strokes. For the last one-and-a-half-month, while facing the red ball or white, wearing blues or flannels, Shubman has been unfailingly annihilating bowlers. The staggering numbers that provide evidence of permanent residency in ‚Äòthe zone‚Äô read as follows. Tests: 1 hundred; ODIs: 2 hundreds, 1 double hundred and T20: 1 hundred. What most batsmen take a lifetime to compile, Shubman spectacularly did in about 45 days.

The uniqueness of Shubman‚Äôs batting is its ubiquitous style. He remains true to the basic tenets of his craft, regardless of the format. Such is the malleability of his original batting style that he doesn‚Äôt need to innovate or break his batting stance and get into some pilates pose. Like Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli before him, Shubman doesn‚Äôt compromise his classical Test-match correctness for the sake of short-term ODI goals or IPL‚Äôs T20 commerce.
Staying inside the line of the ball, banking on good-old back-foot play, light on feet, good stride forward, subtle wrist work are the old-school virtues that form the soul of his batting. On the outside, he is a new-age, strike-rate conscious batsman with six-packs. He also has looks that sell beauty products for men and health drinks.

Since a lot has been said and written about his strokes, leaning on Federer‚Äôs tennis would make for interesting reading. Going back to the Ahmedabad game, watch his booming cover drive at the start of his innings. It was a back of length ball which he played on the up with a smooth swing of the bat that was more angular than upright on the way down. The impact of that shot was akin to the classic Federer ace down the T at the start of the first service game. Perfected by hours of repetition, this is the Indian opener‚Äôs percentage stroke to assert domination. It‚Äôs Shubman‚Äôs signature on the turf, an early sign to put the phone on silent and get comfortable on the couch.
Shubman‚Äôs leg-side play has the wristy magic of Federer‚Äôs single-handed backhand. His unique short-arm pull to mid-wicket is the same as the tennis legend‚Äôs deep dying backhand slice. The least spectacular of their shots, they happen to be ones the connoisseurs drool over. Judging the length early and a frenzied wristy maneuver being the secret of these shots.

That elegant Shubman flick to mid-wicket, delivered with that upright stance, makes cricket fans go weak in their knees. That comes close to Federer‚Äôs iconic one-handed top-spin, the freeze frame of which has donned book covers, tournament promotion hoardings and insta Grand Slam updates. Shubman gets on top of the ball to control the trajectory of the ball. The long levers of his tall frame add power to those precise strokes ‚Äì the two combine beautifully to exploit the gaps between the fielders. There‚Äôs also the aerial variety that goes over the square leg.
Federer‚Äôs on-the-run backhand pass is Shubman‚Äôs dancing down the track straight lofted hit into the sightscreen. It‚Äôs a crowd favourite, it makes the eyes bulge and the simultaneous shaking of head in disbelief. It‚Äôs also what makes fans book tickets the next time the player of that glorious shot comes to their city.

Temperamentally too, the two are similar. Federer on the junior circuit was a tantrum-throwing, racket banging brat. Shubman wasn‚Äôt that bad, though there has been an episode with an umpire during a Ranji game during days he was making a transition from a promising junior to a senior team regular. This was before their present-day Zen mode.

Federer was no Boris Becker, he wasn‚Äôt an instant hit when he first burst on to the international circuit. Shubman too has been in and out of the team. The Swiss legend ironed out technical flaws on his backhand, to emerge as regular Slam winner. Shubman too seems to have worked around his previous problem of rather slow transfer of weight onto the front foot.
If Ahmedabad was Basel, will the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy be his 2001 Wimbledon moment ‚Äì when Federer defeated Sampras? India might have been blown away with his aesthetically pleasing and highly entertaining batting, but it remains to be seen if he has impressed the team management enough. Will Rahul Dravid and Rohit Sharma prefer the recently married senior opener KL Rahul or punt on the boy with the Midas touch?
Many winters back, the national selectors had faced a similar dilemma. The committee to pick the India squad for the 1989 Pakistan tour had faced a logjam over picking the 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar. The chairman was worried, he threw up a few thoughts: What if Baby Tendulkar failed? What would it do to his psyche? That‚Äôs when the West Zone selector Naren Tamhane uttered the memorable words that changed Indian cricket forever. ‚ÄúGentlemen, Sachin never fails,‚Äù he said.

Shubman needs to pad up first for the Tests against Australia. The decision-makers need to know their history. Someone needs to show Tamhane-kind of conviction in the youth. Remember, when in doubt, India has historically thrown its weight behind their batting prodigies.

"Netflix raises prices and adds subscribers, despite strikes",The price hikes were announced in an earnings report that showed the company's global subscriber base reached 247 million at the end of September.,"Netflix increased subscription prices for some streaming plans in the United States, Britain and France on Wednesday as it shattered expectations for new customers, sending its shares surging 13%.
Almost 9 million subscribers joined Netflix around the globe in the third quarter, surpassing Wall Street analysts‚Äô forecast for 6 million, according to LSEG. Netflix said it expected a similar number of additions in the current quarter.
The strong performance showed Netflix was thriving despite Hollywood labor tensions that shut down a large swath of U.S. production. Netflix makes many of its shows and movies overseas, which accounted for the bulk of its new sign-ups.

Netflix pointed to the global success of ‚ÄúOne Piece,‚Äù a live-action adaptation of the venerable Japanese manga series and an example of its hefty investment in stories with local resonance that travel the world. The streaming giant also attracted new audiences to long-running television shows, such as the legal drama ‚ÄúSuits,‚Äù which it licensed from Comcast , and HBO‚Äôs World War Two series ‚ÄúBand of Brothers.‚Äù

Hollywood‚Äôs film and television writers ratified a new contract this month, but actors remain on strike. Sarandos said Netflix was ‚Äútotally committed to ending this strike.‚Äù
The company‚Äôs third-quarter customer gains represented its strongest quarterly uptick since the second quarter of 2020, when lockdowns early in the global pandemic led to an unprecedented surge in streaming subscriptions.

Netflix increased the U.S. price of its premium ad-free plan by $3 per month to $22.99. The cost for premium rose by 2 pounds to 17.99 pounds in Britain and by 2 euros to 19.99 euros in France.
Investors welcomed the news, sending Netflix shares climbing to $390.80 in extended trading from a close of $346.19.
PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore said the third-quarter growth at Netflix was a testament to its recent crackdown on password sharing and the opportunities for growth as it moves into advertising.
‚ÄúIt is firing on all cylinders, with recent efforts all heading in the right direction,‚Äù he said.

During the quarter, ‚ÄúSuits‚Äù became the most-watched title across film, original TV and acquired TV on streaming in the U.S. for 12 straight weeks after it hit Netflix. The series, starring Prince Harry‚Äôs wife, Meghan Markle, originally aired on the USA cable network from 2011 to 2019.

Why Vijay Sethupathi being Vijay Sethupathi in all his films makes him a great actor,"While talking about Vijay Sethupathi, the term 'versatility' is widely used. However, in reality, the actor retains a sense of sameness in his variety, and it only makes him unique rather than redundant.","Method acting or ‚Äògetting under the skin of a character‚Äô is not something you see a lot in Indian cinema. More often than not, all our heroes, especially stars, are pretty much themselves in all their films. Vijay and Leo are identical to Leo and Parthiban. Rajinikanth in Jailer is not all that different from Petta. At best, we get to see different looks of the same person. Rajinikanth was honest when he said at the Ponniyin Selvan 1 audio launch that he just has a set of templates. That‚Äôs pretty much the ‚Äòmethod‚Äô of all the actors. Interestingly, being himself in all of his films is what makes Vijay Sethupathi original. It is an irony that here‚Äôs an actor who remains himself in all of his films, and we love him for it.
For some reason, Sethupathi doesn‚Äôt have to do much. Take the scene in Sriram Raghavan‚Äôs Merry Christmas where he is in the neighbourhood gift shop. The owner recognises and asks him if he is Albert. Sethupathi doesn‚Äôt do much other than a gentle nod. She then goes, ‚ÄúYou have returned from Dubai?‚Äù Nod. ‚ÄúHow is Dubai?‚Äù He finally opens up, ‚ÄúToo many rules.‚Äù He has actually come from jail. In another instance, he is bewildered by the actions of the other lead character, and all he does is look at her perplexed in the lift. For a Tamil audience, they have seen Sethupathi cut that look so many times, but it is hard to get enough of it. It is lovely to watch Vijay Sethupathi doing Vijay Sethupathi things.

Liberos might not exist but Beckenbauer‚Äôs soul is still integral part of modern football,"Like the late German legend several full-backs continue to counterattack with a quick offensive transition, none as efficiently as Manchester City‚Äôs John Stones.","It was a slap that changed the course of German football. Growing up in Giesing, a war-ravaged working-class suburb of Munich, now in the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium, young Franz Beckenbauer was a pacy centre forward who wanted to play for 1860 Munich, the strongest German club in the 1950s. But as destiny charted, during an U-14 game for local team SC 1906, he was fiercely marked and supposedly slapped by Gerhard K√∂nig, the 1860 youth team defender. In anger, he refused to join 1860 and signed for then minnows, Bayern Munich.
At Munich, a sharp youth coach realised that he was so skillful and quick, he was prone to rugged tackles and injuries. So he decided to hide him in the midfield, probably knowing that the kid was so intelligent and technically sound that his attacking prowess would not be stifled wherever he played. He would spend his early days as the base of midfield, more like a deep-lying playmaker as well as a defensive cover, before he was shifted to the heart of the defence. But his instincts meant he would carry the ball upfield and score goals (he scored seven in his first 13 appearances for his country).",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/liberos-franz-beckenbauer-soul-part-modern-football-john-stones-9109370/,sports
Satellite connectivity on smartphones explained: How soon will India get it?,Several smartphone brands are bringing satellite comms to mainstream 5G devices. Here‚Äôs how it works and why it matters for India‚Äôs connectivity.,"With the new iPhone 14, Apple has made a big deal about having satellite connectivity which lets you send SOS messages without WiFi or cell service. But how does it even work?
Basically, regular cell phones connect to towers on the ground. The closer you are to a tower, the more bars you see on your status bar and the better the service. Move too far away and you lose signal. But satellite phones beam signals up to satellites orbiting above Earth. Each satellite covers significantly more area than a single cell tower, meaning phones with satellite connectivity maintain connections better in remote places without ground towers nearby.
This is especially useful for emergencies in rural or disaster areas with limited cell infrastructure. The only catch is that satellite connectivity typically requires specialised hardware, specifically an antenna that can transmit to satellites and receive signals from them. But there‚Äôs an emerging technology that does away with the need for such hardware.
ADVERTISEMENT
What‚Äôs 5G-NTN?
This technology is 5G NTN, which stands for 5G Non-Terrestrial Network. It lets phones tap satellites for data when they can‚Äôt reach land-based 5G towers, helping users stay connected for sending messages, GPS, and voice and video calls.
Before, satellite phones were niche devices separate from regular cellular networks. But with standards like NR-NTN that companies like MediaTek are pushing, satellite comms can be built right into 5G smartphones ‚Äì there‚Äôs no need for specialised hardware anymore.
The satellite connectivity space is heating up
Several leading smartphone brands showcased their latest advancements in satellite connectivity at Mobile World Congress 2023. This highlights how the industry is ramping up efforts to bring robust satellite communication capabilities to mainstream 5G smartphones.
MediaTek demonstrated its NR-NTN technology for two-way messaging via satellite on Android phones. It also revealed its next-generation NR-NTN for higher satellite data rates and expanded use cases. MediaTek already has commercial devices on the market integrating its satellite tech through partners like Motorola.
ADVERTISEMENT
Meanwhile, Qualcomm announced partnerships with Honor, Motorola, Nothing, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi to enable satellite messaging on premium phones equipped with its Snapdragon Satellite platform. Qualcomm‚Äôs solution supports connections with both geosynchronous and low-earth orbit satellites.
Samsung also unveiled an Exynos chipset with built-in satellite connectivity that can power smartphones and other devices. Their chip is capable of working with multiple satellite networks.
India‚Äôs satellite connectivity ecosystem
India is a huge potential market for satellite tech in phones. With remote terrain and developing infrastructure, satellites can help extend reliable connectivity.
Reliance Jio recently launched JioSpaceFiber, India‚Äôs first satellite broadband service promising fiber-optic like speeds. This leverages satellites to deliver reliable high-speed internet and entertainment to consumers and businesses everywhere.
ADVERTISEMENT
Airtel has partnered with OneWeb for a joint venture called Airtel OneWeb. They already received regulatory approval to offer satellite service in India. Airtel‚Äôs chairman predicts that OneWeb will start providing coverage across all of India as soon as next month.
Between progress on 5G rollout and satellite connectivity, India is taking steps to connect even its most remote regions. However, there are still challenges around factors like spectrum allocation, data security, pricing competition, and regulations that need to be worked through as satellite-linked smartphones develop in India. But the technology could help digitally empower people across the country through enhanced connectivity.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/satellite-connectivity-smartphones-how-it-works-india-9019052/,technology
X users will soon be able to make calls without sharing phone numbers,"According to Elon Musk, X users will soon be able to make audio and video calls without needing to share their phone number.","Elon Musk today announced that X (formerly Twitter) users will soon be able to call each other without requiring a phone number. It looks like the feature will be available on the majority of platforms like iOS, Android, Mac and Windows.
According to a post by Musk on X, video and audio calls are coming to the platform with X acting as the ‚Äòeffective global address book‚Äô. It might mean users won‚Äôt have to save phone numbers and will be able to call each other by simply looking up their username.

"RBI nudges banks to settle UAE trades in rupee, dirham: Report","The move is part of the Reserve Bank of India's broader aim of promoting settlement in local currencies with countries with which India has a trade deficit, with the knock-on effect of boosting the rupee's global reach.","India‚Äôs central bank is nudging local banks to ask their clients to settle trade between the United Arab Emirates and India using the dirham (AED) or Indian rupee (INR) to reduce U.S.-dollar-based transactions, five sources told Reuters.
The move is part of the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs broader aim of promoting settlement in local currencies with countries with which India has a trade deficit, with the knock-on effect of boosting the rupee‚Äôs global reach, three banking sources said.
India‚Äôs trade deficit with the UAE was $21.62 billion in 2022/23, or 8.2% of its total deficit, government data shows. In July, the two countries agreed to facilitate trade in rupees instead of dollars.
ADVERTISEMENT
The idea, a government source said, was to reduce the outflow of dollars on account of this trade deficit.
‚ÄúThe RBI has asked banks to encourage clients and corporates to initiate INR-AED trades gradually, instead of using the dollar,‚Äù said a treasury official at a private bank.
An RBI official communicated this message verbally to foreign exchange dealers at a seminar this month, four sources said. This communication has not been previously reported.
None of the sources wished to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media. The RBI and trade ministry did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
ADVERTISEMENT
The RBI may consider setting internal targets for the quantum of India-UAE trade it would like to see moved away from dollars, said the government source.
The central bank is ‚Äúkeen that volumes of such trades go up‚Äù and ‚Äúhas assured the market that they will be ready to support banks with INR-AED trades,‚Äù this banker said.
While data on such cross-currency trade volumes is not publicly available, at least three bankers said the current volume is low and may act as a hurdle for corporates to pay for the entire import in dirhams.
ADVERTISEMENT
Indeed, earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp paid Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) in rupees to buy a million barrels of oil.
‚ÄúThe RBI is telling banks to first encourage large clients and corporates to start INR-AED trades because their balance sheets are relatively stronger,‚Äù another banker said.
But large corporates have, so far, been reluctant in engaging in non-dollar-denominated deals, said a banker with a state-run firm.
With smaller companies, on the other hand, bankers have pushed for such transactions by offering discounted service charges as an incentive, the banker said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/reserve-bank-nudges-banks-settle-uae-trades-rupee-dirham-8902476/,business
Too much eyestrain? This iOS 17 feature can improve your eye health,Do you often unknowingly hold your phone too close to your eyes? iOS 17 can help you with that.,"Many of us grew up watching cartoons on TV, and we probably heard our parents telling us to move away from the screen if we were sitting too close. They had a good reason: sitting too close to the TV can strain our eyes and make us more likely to develop nearsightedness.
But now, TV screens are not the only ones we stare at. We also have smartphones that we can take with us everywhere, and sometimes we hold them too close to our eyes without realising it. And unlike our parents, there is no one to remind us to keep a healthy distance between our eyes and our phones.
What if we could have a feature on our phones that would act like a parent and warn us when we are holding them too close to our eyes? Well, if you have an iPhone with iOS 17, you can enable such a feature and protect your eye health. Let‚Äôs take a look.

How to enable Screen Distance on iOS 17
Apple‚Äôs latest update for its mobile devices, iOS 17, comes with a new feature that aims to help users maintain a healthy distance from their screens. Screen Distance uses the TrueDepth camera, which is also used for Face ID, to measure how far your eyes are from your iPhone or iPad screen. If you tend to hold your device too close to your face for too long, Screen Distance will gently remind you to move it away.

Screen Distance is automatically enabled for children under 13 (this age may vary depending on your region) who are part of a Family Sharing group. For adults, you can turn on Screen Distance manually by following these steps:
1. Open Settings and tap on Screen Time.
2. Tap on Screen Distance and then tap on Continue.
3. You‚Äôll see an explanation of how Screen Distance works now. Just tap on Continue again.

That‚Äôs it. Now your device will check the distance between your screen and eyes periodically. If it detects that you are holding your device closer than 12 inches (30 centimeters) for an extended period, it will show you a message saying ‚ÄúiPhone May Be Too Close.‚Äù You can then adjust the distance until you see a checkmark on the screen, and then tap on Continue to resume what you were doing.

Screen Distance is designed to protect your eyes from strain and fatigue caused by too much screen time. It does not collect any photos or videos of your face, and it does not send any data to Apple or anyone else. All the processing is done locally on your device.
Screen Distance is one of the many features that iOS 17 offers to improve your digital well-being. You can also use Screen Time to set limits and goals for your app usage, Downtime to schedule time away from your device, and Communication Limits to control who you can contact during certain hours.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/ios-17-screen-distance-how-to-8976377/,technology

"FPIs flood Indian equity markets, infuse Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2023 despite global uncertainty",This follows Indian equities witnessing the worst-ever net outflow of Rs 1.21 lakh crore by FPIs in 2022 on aggressive rate hikes by the central banks globally after net inflows for three consecutive years.,"In a dazzling resurgence, foreign investors have graced the Indian equity markets with an influx of nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2023, fuelled by optimism over the country‚Äôs resilient economic fundamentals amid shadows of a gloomy global scenario. Experts believe that the positive trend may continue in 2024.
This follows Indian equities witnessing the worst-ever net outflow of Rs 1.21 lakh crore by FPIs in 2022 on aggressive rate hikes by the central banks globally after net inflows for three consecutive years.
Going forward, as the general elections approach next year, political stability and economic growth will become focal points for foreign investors. Besides, global cues on the inflation and interest rate scenario would dictate the flow of foreign money into Indian equities, said Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director ‚Äì Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Research India.
ADVERTISEMENT
India, with its promising position for economic growth, is expected to continue attracting foreign investment flows, he added.
As of now, the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have made a net investment of around Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the Indian equity markets and around Rs 60,000 crore in the debt market. Collectively, they pumped over Rs 2 lakh crore into the capital market, according to data available from the depositories.
Of Rs 1.5 lakh crore net equity market inflow, close to Rs 43,000 crore have been invested in the first two weeks of December following the enhanced political stability, owing to the BJP‚Äôs success in recent elections across three significant states. If this trend persists, it could become the best year for FPI flow.
FPIs made a net infusion of Rs 25,752 crore in equities in 2021, Rs 1.7 lakh crore in 2020, which was the best year, and Rs 1.01 lakh crore in 2019.
ADVERTISEMENT
In the year 2022, the flows from foreign investors were largely driven by factors like inflation and interest rate scenarios in developed markets, such as the US and UK, currency movement, the trajectory of crude oil prices, geopolitical scenario and the health of the domestic economy, among others, Srivastava said.
Heightened FPI investment was triggered by the nation‚Äôs resilient economic fundamentals, forward-looking policy reforms, optimistic corporate earnings outlook, global liquidity trends, and a growing recognition of India‚Äôs enduring long-term growth potential, said Bharat Dhawan, Managing Partner, Mazars in India. Mazars is an international audit, tax and advisory firm.
‚ÄúIndia is one of the top investment destinations of FPIs. There is a near consensus now in the global investing community that India has the best prospects among the emerging economies for sustained growth for many years to come,‚Äù said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThis growth has the potential to create phenomenal wealth through the stock market. FPIs are investing to benefit from this potential wealth creation,‚Äù he added.
After pulling back for three consecutive years, foreign investors made a comeback in the debt markets as well this year, as they injected around Rs 60,000 crore in 2023 (till December 15), marking a noteworthy shift in their capital flow.
They took out funds totalling Rs 15,910 crore in 2022, Rs 10,359 crore in 2021, and Rs 1.05 lakh crore in 2020.
The announcement by JP Morgan Chase & Co in September that it will add Indian government bonds to its benchmark emerging market index from June next year has influenced the inflow in the country‚Äôs bond markets this year, said Mayank Mehraa, smallcase Manager and Principal Partner at Craving Alpha.
This landmark inclusion, scheduled for June 2024, is expected to benefit India by attracting around USD 20-40 billion in the subsequent 18-24 months. This can make Indian bonds more accessible to foreign investors and potentially strengthen the rupee, thereby, bolstering the economy.
ADVERTISEMENT
In terms of sectors, FPIs preferred financial, IT, pharma, and energy sectors owing to the country‚Äôs strength in technology and healthcare, and commitment to sustainable development contributed to the appeal for foreign investors.
FPIs started the year on a negative note, and a departure of ‚Äúhot money‚Äù was seen in the first two months when they pulled out over Rs 34,000 crore.
ADVERTISEMENT
But, FPIs shifted gears and turned buyers in March and incessantly purchased equities till August on the resilience of the Indian economy amid an uncertain global macro backdrop. During these six months, they pumped in Rs 1.74 lakh crore.
However, FPIs departed from equities in September, and the negative trend continued in the succeeding month, owing to economic uncertainties in the US and Eurozone regions as well as growing concerns about global economic growth.
ADVERTISEMENT
Additionally, higher crude prices, sticky inflation numbers, and the expectation that the interest rate may continue to remain at elevated levels longer than expected prompted foreign investors to adopt a wait-and-watch approach.
In November, FPIs again turned buyers with a net investment of Rs 9,000 crore, and the positive momentum has continued this month on the outcome of recent elections across three significant states.
Internationally, signals from the US Federal Reserve about three prospective rate cuts in the upcoming year marked a departure from the prevailing high-interest rate regime also prompted FPIs to invest.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/fpis-flood-indian-equity-markets-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-in-2023-global-uncertainty-9071533/,business
OpenAI shelves Arrakis AI: All you need to know about model named after desert in ‚ÄòDune‚Äô,The researchers working on Arrakis AI decided to shelve the project as its performance was inefficient.,"Ever since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the world has never been the same.

OpenAI which introduced ChatGPT based on its Large Language Model (LLM) GPT-3 went on to update the chatbot with its advanced version, the GPT-4. 
While GPT-4 has endowed some incredible abilities to ChatGPT, there have been speculations around other models that the AI powerhouse has been working on. However, the Sam Altman-led company has been working clandestinely on most of its AI projects. Recently, it was reported that OpenAI has shelved its AI model that was named after the dystopian desert featured in the Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster ‚ÄòDune‚Äô ‚Äì Arrakis.

"Leander Paes laments state of Indian Davis Cup, says will take a decade to lift standard",The Indian Davis Cup team was relegated to World Group 2 for the first time after a 2-3 loss to Denmark in their away fixture earlier this month.,"Indian tennis icon Leander Paes is pained by the relegation of the country‚Äôs Davis Cup team and feels it will take a ‚Äúbetter half of a decade‚Äù to lift the standard.
The Indian Davis Cup team was relegated to World Group 2 for the first time after a 2-3 loss to Denmark in their away fixture earlier this month.
‚ÄúI feel like it‚Äôs going to take a few years, until the Davis Cup team has some serious talent in it,‚Äù said the player with a record 45 doubles victories in Davis Cup.
Indian tennis‚Äô decline was apparent during the Australian Open last month when, for the first time since 2017, no player from the country could make the cut to compete in the qualification round of a Grand Slam.
‚ÄúI feel quite saddened in a way that we don‚Äôt have one player in the singles ranking in the top-300. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ever happened,‚Äù said the Olympic bronze medallist.
Prajnesh Gunneswaran is currently the highest-ranked Indian in singles at 306 on the ATP list.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve tremendous respect for all our Indian players who are travelling on the circuit in a sport like tennis where the cost of training and conducting (making a) the career is so expensive.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn tennis, where 99 per cent of the sport is played outside the country, being alone on the circuit is not easy. Zeeshan (Ali) and I have slept in locker rooms because we didn‚Äôt have money to pay for a hotel.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThat being said, I think it‚Äôs going to take a better half of a decade for the Davis Cup team to have that quality like we had when Ramesh Krishnan, Zeeshan Ali, Vijay Amritraj and all of us had‚Ä¶ To get to the semi-finals in the Davis Cup is tougher now,‚Äù he said.
Leander was addressing the media sitting beside his father Dr Vece Paes, a bronze medallist at the 1971 hockey World Cup in Barcelona, and the Munich Olympics in 1972.
Biopic in the pipeline
Leander, who campaigned for the Trinamool Congress ahead of the Goa Assembly elections last year, refused to take any political questions and said he‚Äôs currently busy working on a biopic to portray the father-son duo‚Äôs legacy on the big screen. He revealed that it should be ready in 18 months.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on my own story right now. I will give a little nugget today that the Leander storyboard is being worked on right now. I can‚Äôt speak much about it.
‚ÄúIt will be a story of how baba (father) won his Olympic medal in 1972 and a few of you are old enough to know what happened there.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúYou all will understand why a young boy growing up to my father‚Äôs history, my passion was to emulate him. So it‚Äôs going to be about 1972 to 1996 really.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be an inspirational story on how not necessarily you have to be the tallest, most talented, skilled (person) to become an athlete‚Ä¶ Not necessarily you will have to have great infrastructure either.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on a storyboard at the moment and hopefully in 18 months you will get to see it and the posters will be out there.‚Äù Asked whether he wants to get into sports administration and join the All India Tennis Association (AITA), he gave an indirect reply.
‚ÄúI was born into a house where both my parents played for Tiranga (Tri-colour), I grew up in a house where I ironed my father‚Äôs playing jersey, which had No. 10 on it. My mother‚Äôs jersey was No. 5,‚Äù said Leander, who was born into a sports family with father a hockey Olympian and mother, Jennifer, an Indian basketball captain.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWhen I look at India as a whole, for me doing things for the community and creating opportunities for the youth is the most important thing. The next decade would be very interesting as we are the youngest country in the world.
‚ÄúWhen you talk about sports as a vehicle to give opportunity to the youth, that is where my passion is. My passion is giving opportunities to the youth so that they can live their dreams.‚Äù
Djokovic, the GOAT
Leander also hailed Novak Djokovic‚Äôs Australian Open victory last month, that brought him on par with Rafael Nadal‚Äôs 22 career Grand Slams.
The win came just a year after the Serbian was deported from the same venue for not being vaccinated against COVID-19.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúDjokovic didn‚Äôt get a chance to play in Australia because of COVID issues, but it was wonderful to see him winning the Australian Open on his return last month.
‚ÄúFor me his perseverance, his tenacity, his grit is something that I admire a lot. Yes, he gets a bit of a bad reputation because of the way he conducts the passion, the confidence that he has, the way he‚Äôs bold in making statements.
‚ÄúA few people may not like his personality but for me I‚Äôve so much respect for his personality. He comes from a country that is really hard and tough and from there to become a champion, speaks a lot.

Zepto becomes India‚Äôs first unicorn in nearly a year in new funding round,"Zepto said on Friday it has raised $200 million in fresh funding at a valuation of $1.4 billion, making it the first startup in the country to cross the billion-dollar valuation mark in nearly a year.","Grocery startup Zepto said on Friday it has raised $200 million in fresh funding at a valuation of $1.4 billion, making it the first startup in the country to cross the billion-dollar valuation mark in nearly a year.
Zepto said it raised the funds ‚Äúin the midst of the deepest downturn in capital markets in over a decade‚Äù from U.S-based investment firms StepStone Group and Goodwater Capital. Existing backers including Nexus Venture Partners, Glade Brook Capital and Lachy Groom also participated in the deal.
Zepto, which promises delivery of groceries in 10 minutes, was started in 2021 by two 19-year-old Stanford dropouts, and competes with SoftBank-funded Swiggy and Blinkit, which are all betting on fast deliveries in the so-called quick commerce sector. Even among them, Zepto‚Äôs CEO Aadit Palicha said the company has the quickest average delivery time of 13 minutes.

Zepto plans to use the funds to go deeper into the seven Indian metros it is currently present in, including Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, where it makes a monthly revenue of $50 million-$60 million, Palicha told Reuters.
‚ÄúOperating in a bear market has forced us to be more disciplined. There is no (question of) growth or profit, it has to be both.‚Äù The company is also planning an initial public offering in 2025, he said, without giving further details.
While Zepto is still loss-making, a majority of its so-called dark stores ‚Äì densely located warehouses ‚Äì generate cash and the company aims to be profitable in 12-15 months, it said.
The company will consider expanding to new cities after a year, Palicha said.

Zepto was valued at $900 million when it last raised funds in May 2022. A company statement said it has tripled sales year-on-year and will achieve $1 billion in annualised sales in the next few quarters.

Boeing asks airlines to inspect 737 Max jets for potential loose bolt,Boeing's 737 Max jets were grounded worldwide for 20 months after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed a total of 346 people.,"Boeing is asking airlines to inspect its 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder control system, the airplane maker and Federal Aviation Administration confirmed this week.
The FAA said it would be ‚Äúclosely monitoring‚Äù the targeted inspections. The agency said Thursday that Boeing issued its inspection guidance to airlines after an international operator found a bolt with a missing nut during routine maintenance. In a separate case, Boeing also discovered an undelivered aircraft that had a nut that was not properly tightened.
‚ÄúThe issue identified on the particular airplane has been remedied,‚Äù the Arlington, Virginia, company told The Associated Press on Friday. ‚ÄúOut of an abundance of caution, we are recommending operators inspect their 737 MAX airplanes and inform us of any findings.‚Äù

Boeing added that it will continue to update both customers and federal regulators on the progress.

The FAA said it will remain in contact with Boeing and impacted airlines as the inspections are performed, and potentially ‚Äúconsider additional action based on any further discovery of loose or missing hardware.‚Äù
According to Boeing, there have been no in-flight incidents caused by this condition to date ‚Äî noting that crews‚Äô routine checks would signal if the rudder was not working properly before an aircraft pushes back from the gate.
The company added that all airplanes Boeing is set to deliver onward will have the inspection (which is estimated to take about two hours per plane) prior to delivery.

US carriers with 737 Max jets in their fleet include United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines. All four of these carriers told The Associated Press Friday that they don‚Äôt expect operational impacts. Southwest, for example, said it was currently performing all of these inspections during routine overnight maintenance.
A firm timeline for the inspections wasn‚Äôt provided for each airline, but Alaska said it expected to complete the process by the first half of January.
Boeing‚Äôs 737 Max jets were grounded worldwide for 20 months after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed a total of 346 people. Investigations focused on an automated flight-control system that pushed the nose of the plane down based on faulty sensor readings. Boeing did not tell pilots and airlines about the system until after the first crash.

The FAA, which also faced criticism for the way it approved the Max jets prior to these deadly crashes, has since moved to provide a more-detailed certification process for large planes and required safety disclosures.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/boeing-airlines-737-max-jets-inspection-loose-bolt-9089336/,business

"US issues record-breaking 1,40,000 visas to Indian students last year: Official","The US has issued more than 10.5 million visas in 2023 so far, which is 2 million more than what it had anticipated and is almost hitting the highest-ever level at its overseas missions.","As part of the Biden administration‚Äôs endeavour to promote people-to-people ties with India, the US issued more than 1,40,000 visas to Indian students last year and is taking several steps to reduce visa appointment wait period.
In an interview, Julie Stufft, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Visa Services, said US missions in India worked six, seven days a week to make sure that students could be interviewed before their classes started. This year, the US made a huge effort to concentrate on the demand coming out of India, she said.
‚ÄúWe are really proud of what we have done in India this year. I think for the first time in history, we set a goal to issue one million visas in India and not only did we accomplish that, but it was done several months in advance. So, the number will go way beyond that.

‚ÄúThere are record-setting numbers this year for workers, crew members and students applying in India to come to the United States,‚Äù she added.
Stufft further said, ‚ÄúWe specifically made sure that we saw the students who were applying coming out of India. India is now the largest source country for foreign students in the United States, as well as many other visa categories. That‚Äôs a very important one for us. We have also had a lot of cases where the interview was waived, so no interview for Indian travellers who have previously travelled and are now going back to the US.‚Äù Last year, the US issued a record over 1,40,000 visas to Indian students, she said.
‚ÄúFor students who are applying in India, I would say the biggest thing is that the missions there have worked six, seven days a week to interview students to make sure that everyone can be interviewed before their classes start. The amount of effort and importance that we place on Indian students coming to the US is born out in the visa process. We want to make sure everyone has that chance,‚Äù she said.
The US, Stufft said, is working on taking several steps to reduce the visa appointment wait time in India, which is still a bit high.

‚ÄúI hope it will be (coming down) this year, meaning this fiscal year for us. But we are sending huge numbers of officers to India to manage the wait time and move them around the country as needed. I mean, it has gotten much better but it still needs to come down quite a bit,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúWe had a state visit recently. Everyone from the president of course, to Ambassador (Eric) Garcetti and the secretary of state is so committed to making sure that the people-to-people ties between our two countries expand. We are carrying that out in the visa process. So, we really expect more innovations and a much quicker process in the future,‚Äù Stufft told.
The State Department official said anyone who is interested in travelling to the US for any reason should apply as soon as possible.

‚ÄúIf you are travelling for work-related reasons, there‚Äôs another special avenue to use. There is a special channel to use so that business-related visas are also prioritised. Bear with us, I would say as we get through this.
‚ÄúIndia is unique because it represents the highest number of visas in several categories. Not just visitors, not just students, not just maritime crew members but highly skilled work. I mean, it is a tremendous demand across the board for us. So our priority is to get all of those wait times down,‚Äù she said.

During a media round table with a group of foreign journalists organised by the Foreign Press Centre, Stufft said the US has issued more than 10.5 million visas in 2023 so far, which is 2 million more than what it had anticipated and is almost hitting the highest-ever level at its overseas missions.
‚ÄúHalf of our overseas missions set their own record for that country for adjudications of visas in that country. We set records for visa adjudication, for work visas and for student visas as well in some (other) categories,‚Äù she said.
For 2024, the US is still working very hard on reducing wait times, Stufft said.
‚ÄúIn some overseas locations, we still have very high wait times, some exceeding a year still for one category of visa, which is a first-time visitor, someone who needs an interview for their visa.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúAll other categories have low wait times globally, but we are very focused on the first-time visitor interview wait times and what‚Äôs very interesting to us is that many of the places where we have set records for visa production this year are the same places where we still have really high wait times. This just indicates a very high level of demand and we are going to use this year to really get control of that in these five or six places with very high wait times,‚Äù she said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/us-issues-record-breaking-140000-visas-to-indian-students-last-year-official-study-abroad-9047109/,education
Parul University‚Äôs excellent program outcome for B.Pharm: The importance of solid academics and strategic industrial ties,"Further progress in the sector beckons universities to set up their game towards research-oriented B.Pharm programs, a feat that Parul University has been successful at since its inception.","The advent of modern pharmaceutical science has been the bedrock of the quality of life we enjoy today. Already India for long has been known as a global leader in the supply of pharmaceuticals, a legacy which was further bolstered during the pandemic by the domestic production of COVID vaccines. However, anyone from the medical fraternity will attest that there is still much advancement to be made in pharmaceutical research to cope with the health challenges we continue to face. This is where the role of the education sector comes in.  Further progress in the sector beckons universities to set up their game towards research-oriented B.Pharm programs, a feat that Parul University has been successful at since its inception.
Considering that the pharmaceutical industry demands professionals who are adept at both practical research and academic knowledge of the domain, the Vadodara-based university ensures that learning research skills is an inseparable part of its B.Pharm program, which also has a lateral entry option. Apart from top educators from IITs, NITs, and IISc, Parul University has 45+ world-class laboratories dedicated to pharmaceutical research, ensuring a research-focused program outcome. The facilities include the Chemistry and Pharmaceutics Lab, the Central Research Lab, the Quality Assurance Lab, the Skill & Simulation Lab, and access to work in a 750-bedded hospital. But most importantly, what makes the university program so unique as compared to its counterparts is the strategic alliances that Parul University has forged over the years. These partnerships not just include industry players but also experts, who can guide and nurture talent.
To elaborate, via various platforms, the institute offers the enviable opportunity to launch one‚Äôs research career under the guidance of eminent experts in the discipline, whose presence further accentuates the mettle of Parul University. The domain leaders include Dr. Gordhan Patel, President of JP Laboratories Inc, Padmashree Prof. Dr. Dipankar Chaterjee, who was the former President and Secretary, IASC, Fellow INSA, Padmashree Prof. Dr. Sujoy Guha, associated with the Centre for Biomedical Engg. IIT and AIIMS, New Delhi, and Dr Pravin Ingole, Scientist, CSIR ‚Äì NEIST, Assam. Similarly, in terms of industry collaborations, the university has over 700+ tie-ups that provide a window for the students to be part of cutting-edge research undertakings, giving them a head start to a rewarding career in R&D.
Attesting to the success of the research-focused thrust of the program, Parul University has garnered an impressive amount of research funding, adding to around 15 crores.  Some of the top projects headed by the university were in association with the Royal Academy of Engineering, UK, ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), European Union-funded CABCIN project, and Gujarat Council of Science Technology, amounting to 179 lakhs, 298 lakhs, 63 lakhs and 82 lakhs, respectively. Further, the NAAC A++-ranked university has also been the driving force behind 320+ filed and granted patents, leading the institute to be ranked 7th across the country by the Indian Patent Office. Also, adding to its list of achievements in terms of research, Parul University is DSIR( Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India)-recognised and accredited by the prestigious NABL (National Accreditation Board for Test and Calibration of Laboratories).
About the program and tie-ups, Dr. Parul Patel, Vice President, Parul University said, ‚ÄúEducation at Parul University has always been about what our cohorts can do to contribute to the industry and the society at large. This is why for a medical science-oriented program such as B.Pharm we spared no effort in blending practical and academic learning seamlessly so that both aspects of the discipline get their due attention, leading to an ideal program outcome. We reckon that while top educators can foster a solid theoretical foundation, industry-based training is imperative to strengthen the practical aspects of the subject. This is why we have painstakingly forged industry connections. Moreover, as students participate in industry projects they also develop the ability to collaborate, an essential quality for a good researcher.‚Äù
Additionally, Parul University‚Äôs education has always been about giving back to society. The research collaboration with the prestigious IAMA ( Indian American Medical Association) aimed at exploring medicine and pharmaceutical-centric welfare projects, would be one such example where a strategic partnership of the university has been about helping society. 
The conjoined project with IAMA is also a fine example of international exposure, which again is important for budding scientists, given the fact that the more they are in touch with a synergy of ideas, the more they are likely to flourish. On the global exposure front as well Parul University has left no stone unturned. The university currently enjoys over 75 Global Partnerships.

Finally, the presence of leading companies in the pharma sector including Emcure, Parimal, and Finecure, among others shows how valuable Parul University‚Äôs industry-focused grooming and industry-immersive training is. Moreover, the average package and the highest-earned package of 8 and 30 LPA, respectively, further indicate the institute‚Äôs robust foothold in the industry, especially the R&D sector.

"Salaar box office collection day 6: Prabhas-starrer crosses lifetime collection of Adipurush, punches past Rs 500 crore mark worldwide","Salaar box office collection day 6: Starring Prabhas in the lead role, Salaar has emerged as the actor's biggest hit since his Baahubali films. The film has already surpassed the collection of Radhe Shyam and Adipurush.","Salaar: Part 1 ‚Äì Ceasefire, starring Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran in the lead roles, had a historic start at the Indian box office. The film made Rs 90.7 crore nett on its opening day in India, but even after such a massive start, the film‚Äôs collections have seen a steady drop in subsequent days. The long weekend over the Christmas holidays helped the film‚Äôs box office numbers. After collecting Rs 24.9 crore on Tuesday, the film earned Rs 17 crore on Wednesday, its sixth day of release. This takes Salaar‚Äôs nett domestic collection to Rs 297.40 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk.
This seems like a win for Prabhas, whose previous film, the much-hyped Adipurush, could only manage to make Rs 288.15 crore nett in India through the course of its run. Adipurush ran into controversy soon after its release and was criticised for its visual effects and dialogues. His 2022 film Radhe Shyam, earned only Rs 104.38 crore nett during its run. Salaar will cross the lifetime collection of Prabhas‚Äô 2019 film, Saaho, on its seventh day. Saaho made Rs 310.60 crore through its run. His biggest hit to date is SS Rajamouli‚Äôs Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, which made Rs 1030.42 crore nett in India and grossed Rs 1788.06 crore globally.

Salaar trailer: Prabhas turns into one man army for Prithviraj,Salaar trailer: Prabhas plays the lead role in director Prashanth Neel's film Salaar. The movie will witness a big clash with Shah Rukh Khan's Dunki.,"The trailer of Salaar, starring Prabhas in the lead role, was released on Friday. Directed by Prashanth Neel of KGF fame, the film is less than a month away from its release. It also stars Malayalam star Prithviraj, Shruti Haasan, Jagapati Babu, Eshwari Rao, and Sriya Reddy.
In the 3-minute and 46-second-long trailer, we are given a glimpse of the city of Khansaar which is ruled by some dreaded crime lords. Jagapthi announces his wish of seeing his son Varadha Raja Mannar, played by Prithviraj, as the ‚Äòlord‚Äô of the city. But he has several enemies working against his wish. This is when Prabhas aka Deva enters the scene. Though he is accompanied by his army, the visuals of the trailer suggest he is the one-man army who can one-up the enemies.
Going by the trailer, Salaar promises to be as action-packed and bloody as director Prashanth Neel‚Äôs previous outings, KGF: Chapter 2 and KGF: Chapter 1.

Salaar‚Äôs teaser released in July and at the time, fans wondered if Salaar was in the same universe as KGF. Director Prashanth Neel has previously directed the KGF movies, starring Yash, which have been extremely successful all over the country. In fact, KGF Chapter 2, released in 2022, made over Rs 1200 crore at the worldwide box office and emerged as one of the highest grossing Indian films of all time.
This time around, Prashant‚Äôs film is going against Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Dunki, directed by Rajkumar Hirani. Shah Rukh has had a stellar year at the movies and his films, Pathaan and Jawan, have collectively made over Rs 2000 crore at the global box office. Speaking about this clash, Prashnath had earlier told The Times of India that this was a ‚Äúvery unpleasant situation‚Äù.
For Prabhas, who is leading Salaar, this film will be a big test as he just faced a massive failure with Adipurush, where he played the lead role. In fact, his last two releases ‚Äì Radhe Shyam and Saaho ‚Äì also failed to impress the audience. Prabhas‚Äô last big hit at the theatres was 2017‚Äôs Baahubali 2: The Conclusion.

"Nothing to lose for New Zealand, it‚Äôs India who will be under pressure: Graham Reid","India are coming into Sunday's match after a below par 4-2 win over tournament debutants Wales, forcing them to play in the crossovers instead of a direct quarterfinals, which they would have played had they topped Pool D.","New Zealand have nothing to lose and it will be India who will be under pressure in their knock-out crossover match against the Black Sticks in the FIH Men‚Äôs World Cup, home side head coach Graham Reid said on Saturday.
India are coming into Sunday‚Äôs match after a below par 4-2 win over tournament debutants Wales, forcing them to play in the crossovers instead of a direct quarterfinals, which they would have played had they topped Pool D.
India, who finished second in the pool behind England, will face defending champions Belgium in the quarterfinals if they beat New Zealand on Sunday.
‚ÄúNew Zealand have nothing to lose from their point of view and pressure will be on us. I hope our team will stand up and as I said earlier, if we play our best we can beat any team in the world,‚Äù Reid said at the match eve press conference here.
‚ÄúAs an Australian myself, I know that New Zealand are always tough and we (India) have total respect for them. I am also confident that we will do our job (and win),‚Äù he added.
Playing at home in front of a packed stadium, India are seeking their first podium finish after the gold in the 1975 edition, but the home side is facing the pressure of expectations.
India beat New Zealand twice just a few months ago at the Kalinga Stadium in the Pro League matches and Reid is hoping that the same result will continue.

‚ÄúWe had beaten them twice then. Moreover, our defensive unit is more settled (and better) now than that time. So, we are looking forward to the match.‚Äù Lack of finishing has been one of the main issues for India in the three pool matches.
Asked about that, Reid said, ‚ÄúI agree that we are lacking in finishing the opportunities we have created. But I would have been more worried had we not created opportunities.

‚ÄúBut it is exciting for Raj Kumar Pal (reserve player) to come in for Hardik. He (Pal) is one of our players for the future. He is in good form. He has silky skills and has worked a lot in defence.
‚ÄúFresh legs are always important in the middle of the tournament. So, disappointing for Hardik to miss out but we have enough talent to fill up.‚Äù Captain Harmanpreet said his team will look to reduce the mistakes and work to even score from 50-50 chances.

"‚ÄòThe bowler is not the villain here‚Äô, says Kumar Sangakkara on batters stealing ground at non-striker end","""Every batter has a choice; to stay in their ground, or risk being given out if they try to steal ground, If they choose the latter, they are the ones who are breaking the Law,"" says Kumar Sangakkara.","The World Cricket Committee of the MCC, the custodians of the laws of the game, wants to see the non-striker being run out by the bowler normalised at all age-group levels besides calling for ‚Äúcalm‚Äù on the contentious subject.
Last month, the MCC issued a clarification to the wording of the law following an incident in which bowler Adam Zampa attempted to run out non-striker Tom Rogers in a Big Bash game in January. The clarification involved changing the wording of Law 38.3 to deliver better clarity and dispel ‚Äúmisconceptions‚Äù on it. The World Cricket Committee (WCC) of the MCC, which met at the ICC headquarters in Dubai last week, is now calling for calm across all levels of the game ‚Äî from the grassroots level of recreational cricket to the elite level ‚Äî given that the act of running out a non-striker who opts to steal ground is within the laws of the game.
‚ÄúThe overriding factor is that there is a simple way that all confusion and controversy around this form of dismissal can be eradicated ‚Äì by non-strikers complying with the Law and remaining within their ground until they have seen the ball being released from the bowler‚Äôs hand,‚Äù the MCC said in a statement.
‚ÄúPart of the discussion in Dubai touched on the growing narrative for the bowler to be vilified for this type of dismissal. The committee members were unanimous in their view that the batter stealing ground is the one breaking the Laws of the game and therefore deserving of recrimination.
‚ÄúThey were also in agreement that there is no precedent to require a bowler to give a warning to a batter, confirming they are completely within their right to dismiss the batter on the first occasion they break the Law,‚Äù it added.
The WCC comprises greats of the game including Kumar Sangakkara, Sourav Ganguly, Justin Langer, Alastair Cook, with Mike Gatting being the chairman.
‚ÄúThe bowler is not the villain here. Every batter has a choice; to stay in their ground, or risk being given out if they try to steal ground. If they choose the latter, they are the ones who are breaking the Law,‚Äù said Sri Lankan great Sangakkara.
ADVERTISEMENT
Gatting added: ‚ÄúWe have seen suggestions that this method of dismissal will be attempted more and more at recreational level and there is the possibility of matches descending into chaos. ‚ÄúWhilst attempts may increase in the short term, we would expect batters to learn their responsibilities under the Laws very quickly and drive it out of prominence.‚Äù

Although the wording of the Law has recently been clarified, the timing of when the run out can be attempted is unchanged since 2017, so very little has actually changed.
‚ÄúOur stance on this is simple batters must not steal ground if they do not wish to be given out in this manner. Nor should they be expecting to be given a warning if they do.
‚ÄúIf all non-strikers only left the popping crease once the ball had been released, there would never be the need for such a dismissal again,‚Äù said the former England batter.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/the-bowler-is-not-the-villain-here-says-wcc-member-kumar-sangakkara-on-batters-stealing-ground-at-non-striker-end-8464016/,sports

"India‚Äôs international air passenger volumes touch pre-pandemic levels in H1 FY24, domestic airlines gain market share","In all, the three Tata group airlines--Air India, Air India Express, and Vistara--had a combined market share of 23.5 per cent in terms of international passengers ferried in H1 FY24, higher than that of IndiGo.","India‚Äôs international air passenger traffic appears to have finally shrugged off the COVID-19 baggage, achieving pre-pandemic levels in the first half (H1) of the current financial year. The number of total international flyers travelling from and to India was 3.14 crore in April-September, a tad higher than 3.13 crore passengers in the corresponding six months of 2019‚Äìthe last full half-year period of regular operations before the pandemic froze the aviation industry‚Äìshows an analysis of data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).
Since early 2022, even as the international air travel to and from India was on a path of healthy recovery, it lagged the rapid pace of normalisation in domestic passenger traffic. In H1 of 2022-23 (FY23), the cumulative international passenger count to and from India was 2.47 crore, around 21 per cent lower than the corresponding period of FY20.
Interestingly, the return to pre-pandemic passenger traffic has been accompanied by a notable shift in India‚Äôs international aviation landscape with a jump in the cumulative market share (by passengers carried) of Indian carriers vis-√†-vis foreign airlines, the DGCA data shows. Although foreign airlines still account for a majority of passenger traffic flying into and out of India, the cumulative market share of domestic carriers registered a nearly 9-percentage-point jump in market share from 2019 levels.
ADVERTISEMENT
The combined market share of Indian carriers by passengers carried on international flights was 44.3 per cent in April-September this year, up from 35.4 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019, and 43.7 per cent in H1 of FY23. Of the total of 3.14 crore commuters who flew into or out of India in H1 of the current financial year, Indian airlines carried 1.39 crore passengers.
Leading this expansion in market share, primarily, are IndiGo and Vistara. Air India, which was under government control in 2019 and is now part of the Tata group, also registered an increase in international market share.
On the other hand, financially-stressed SpiceJet registered a contraction in international market share. Go First‚Äôs market share crashed as the Wadia group carrier suspended operations from early May as it filed for bankruptcy. Air India‚Äôs no-frills arm Air India Express saw a marginal decline in market share.
Market share data for the April-September periods of FY21 and FY22 have not been considered as regular international flights had not resumed at the time and bilateral air bubble arrangements were in place.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to industry watchers, fuelling this surge in international market share are: network expansion and higher capacities deployed on international routes by carriers like IndiGo, Vistara, and Air India, slower recovery in capacity deployment by some foreign carriers, and reduction in flights by various North American airlines to avoid Russian airspace due to the Russia-Ukraine war.
Market leader IndiGo‚Äôs share surged to 17.8 per cent in April-September of FY24 from 10.3 per cent four years back, and 15.7 per cent a year ago.
Vistara‚Äôs market share rose to 3.2 per cent in H1 FY24 from 0.1 per cent in the corresponding period of FY20. It is worth noting that the airline had launched international flights in the July-September quarter of FY20, which explains the extremely low base. In April-September of last year, Vistara‚Äôs international market share was 1.9 per cent.
ADVERTISEMENT
Air India‚Äôs international market share expanded to 12.6 per cent in H1 of the current financial year from 11.4 per cent four years ago, and 12.2 per cent a year back. Air India Express, however, regsitered a market share of 7.7 per cent in the six months ended September 2023, against 7.8 per cent in the corresponding period of FY20, and 8 per cent in H1 of the last financial year.
In all, the three Tata group airlines‚ÄìAir India, Air India Express, and Vistara‚Äìhad a combined market share of 23.5 per cent in terms of international passengers ferried in H1 FY24, higher than that of IndiGo.
In April-September of this year, the embattled SpiceJet‚Äôs market share contracted to 2.6 per cent from 4.3 per cent four years ago, and 3.6 per cent a year ago. Go First, which has not taken to the skies since early May, had a market share of 1.3 per cent in H1 FY20 and 2.3 per cent in the April-September of last year. In the first half of the current financial year, the airline ferried just 90,940 passengers on its international flights (almost entirely in April), accounting for merely 0.3 per cent of India‚Äôs overall international passenger count for the six-month period.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/indias-international-air-passenger-volumes-touch-pre-pandemic-levels-in-h1-fy24-domestic-airlines-gain-market-share-9054583/,business

Intel hails ‚Äòlandmark‚Äô as high-volume EUV production begins at Irish plant,"The EUV tools, which are theoretically precise enough to hit a person's thumb with a laser pointer from the moon, will play a key role in meeting Intel's goal of delivering five generations of technology in four years, the U.S. company said.","Chipmaker Intel said on Friday it had begun high-volume production using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines at its $18.5 billion plant in Ireland, calling it a ‚Äúlandmark‚Äù moment as it seeks to regain ground on its rivals.
Once the world‚Äôs leading chip manufacturer, Intel has lost the lead to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, but says it is on track to regain it with manufacturing technology it says will rival the best from the Taiwanese group.
The EUV tools, which are theoretically precise enough to hit a person‚Äôs thumb with a laser pointer from the moon, will play a key role in meeting Intel‚Äôs goal of delivering five generations of technology in four years, the U.S. company said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Intel‚Äôs general manager of technology development Ann Kelleher told Reuters it was on track to meet this target, with two manufacturing processes now complete, a third ‚Äúcoming rapidly‚Äù, and the final two making very good progress.
The plant, in the town of Leixlip outside Dublin, is the first high-volume location for the group‚Äôs Intel 4 manufacturing process, which uses EUV. The technique will produce its forthcoming ‚ÄúMeteor Lake‚Äù chip for laptops, which will pave the way for AI PCs.
The EUV machines, made by Dutch manufacturer ASML, are as big as a bus and cost around $150 million each.
There are currently seven in the plant, where a constant stream of overhead robots, each costing the same as an average BMW car, whiz along 22km of track delivering silicon wafers from tool to tool.
ADVERTISEMENT
Kelleher said Intel expects to receive its first next-generation extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, the High-NA EUV, in Oregon later this year. The company says it will be the first chipmaker to get the machine, which is also made by ASML.
Intel typically finalises new manufacturing processes at a research and development site in the Portland suburb of Hillsboro, Oregon, before exporting the manufacturing template to other sites.
Beyond its facilities in Ireland, Intel plans to build a big chip complex in Germany and a semiconductor assembly and test facility in Poland.
The new sites will benefit from eased funding rules and subsidies in the EU as the bloc looks to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.

"Petrol, diesel sales fall in August as rains ebb demand","Consumption of petrol during August 1-15, was 20.6 per cent more than in the COVID-marred first half of August 2021 and 25.6 per cent more than in pre-pandemic August 2019.","India‚Äôs petrol and diesel consumption fell in the first half of August from the previous month and a year ago, as monsoon rains hit mobility and slowed industrial activity, preliminary data of state-owned firms showed on Wednesday.
This is the second month in a row that fuel sales have fallen. The four months of monsoon generally see muted consumption.
Consumption of diesel, the most consumed fuel in the country accounting for about two-fifths of the demand, fell 5.7 per cent to 2.67 million tonnes from August 1 to 15, compared to the year-ago period.

Consumption had fallen by a steep 15 per cent in the first half of July but picked up in the second fortnight.
Month-on-month sales fell 9.5 per cent, when compared with 2.95 million tonnes of diesel consumed in the first half of July.
Diesel sales typically fall in monsoon months as rains lower demand in the agriculture sector which uses the fuel for irrigation, harvesting and transportation. Also, rains slow vehicular movements.
Consumption of diesel had soared 6.7 per cent and 9.3 per cent in April and May, respectively as agriculture demand picked up and cars yanked up air-conditioning to beat the summer heat. It started to taper in the second half of June after the monsoon set in.

Petrol sales fell 8 per cent to 1.19 million tonnes in the first fortnight of August, when compared with the same period last year.
Consumption had dropped 10.5 per cent in the first fortnight of July but picked up in the latter half. Sales were down 5.2 per cent month-on-month, the data showed.
India‚Äôs economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience and is likely to have surpassed the performance of most major economies during the first half of 2023.

With steady and healthy economic activity and ongoing air travel recovery, India‚Äôs demand for oil products is anticipated to remain strong in the remainder of the fiscal, analysts said.
Consumption of petrol during August 1-15, was 20.6 per cent more than in the COVID-marred first half of August 2021 and 25.6 per cent more than in pre-pandemic August 2019.
Diesel consumption was up 26 per cent over August 1-15, 2021 and 16.8 per cent when compared with August 1-15, 2019.
With the continuing rise in passenger traffic at airports, jet fuel (ATF) demand rose 8.1 per cent to 290,300 tonnes during the first fortnight of August as compared to the same period last year.
It was 66.7 per cent more than in August 2021, but 4.1 per cent lower than pre-COVID August 2019.

Month-on-month jet fuel sales fell 2.1 per cent when compared with 296,500 tonnes in July 1-15, 2023.
Cooking gas LPG sales were up 3.7 per cent year-on-year to 1.21 million tonnes in August 1-15. LPG consumption was almost 12 per cent higher than in August 1-15, 2021 and 11.2 per cent more than pre-COVID August 1-15, 2019.

In a recent interview, Vivek recalled how Shah Rukh left Rakesh stunned with his knowledge of the business and landed a part in the promising movie King Uncle, which starred Jackie Shroff in the lead role. Not just that, he even got a three-film deal with the filmmaker‚Äôs company Filmkraft even though he had not appeared in even one movie until then.
In a chat with Film Companion, Vivek shared that he arranged for a meeting between Rakesh and Shah Rukh. Vivek was well aware that the role of Jackie‚Äôs brother in King Uncle was yet to be cast and he suggested SRK‚Äôs name for the same. When Rakesh met Shah Rukh, he asked the actor point blank, ‚ÄòWhy should I cast you?‚Äô Vivek recalled that he had coached SRK and explained him everything about the business and the actor just turned on the charm when he made his case. As per Vivek, the role that Shah Rukh wanted was going to be offered to Salman Khan who was already a star at that time.

The fund raise follows a reverse merger between parent IDFC Ltd and IDFC First Bank announced earlier this month.
IDFC First Bank has board approval to raise 40 billion rupees. It has already raised close to half that amount through a preferential allotment to IDFC Ltd.

The remaining amount of about 20 billion rupees will be raised in the second half, the source, who declined to be identified as discussions are private, said. IDFC First Bank declined to comment.
Shares of the lender have gained 33% so far this year compared to the Nifty banking index, which is up 6.4%.
Over the past three years, IDFC Bank has brought down its bad loans and accelerated deposit accretion to strengthen its fundamentals, allowing it to raise institutional capital with ease, said the source.
‚ÄúThis will help fund the bank‚Äôs growth.‚Äù
Its deposit base has risen 47% over a year ago to 1.4 trillion rupees as of March 2023, while its loan book of 1.6 trillion, which was weighed down by infrastructure loans, is now heavily weighted in favour of more healthy retail loans.
Gross bad loans have fallen to 1.65% from 4% in March 2021.
ADVERTISEMENT
IDFC Bank can grow 25% on a compounded annual basis and gain market share, said brokerage house Emkay in report dated July 7.
It is expected to deliver a return on assets (RoA) of 1.3-1.5% and a return on equity of 12-15% over the next three years despite factoring in capital raise, the brokerage house said.
Following the reverse merger, shareholders of IDFC will be direct shareholders in IDFC Bank, including the Government of India, which will hold close to 11% in the bank.

There are those that grafted and grounded runs, like Alastair Cook. But most of the successful ones this century were stroke-makers like Matthew Hayden, Hashim Amla, Michael Clarke, Damyn Martyn and Joe Root.","Every day before the nets session, Marnus Labuschagne would stand beside the centre pitch and gaze meditatively at the 22-yard brown patch. He would then shift to the side and shadow bat for a few minutes before picking his kit and strolling to the nets, where he would manufacture a rough with his studs and ask the spinners in the nets to pound the abrade region. After every ball, he would inquire his colleagues on his alignment, his knee-flex, head-position and all such-like little details that have made him a batting colossus in the last two years.
Last year, to perfect his spin-game in the subcontinent before the odyssey to Pakistan and Sri Lanka, he invented what he calls a spin carpet, a rubber mat sprinkled with taped aluminium scraps and metal sheets, from where the ball would bounce, leap or skid depending on where and how the ball lands. ‚ÄúI thought, ‚Äòwell, what‚Äôs the best way I can recreate spin?‚Äô ‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt really predict what it‚Äôs doing so you have to come up with a plan and a method,‚Äù he tweeted.
Like Labuschagne, his colleagues too have elaborately prepared to deal with the vicissitudes of subcontinental turners, from preparing on scuffed-up surfaces with low bounce, practising Asia-specific strokes, like the sweeps, using the feet more proactively to meet them on the pitch, art of manoeuvring singles and twos, using the depth of the crease smartly, analysing the bowlers, watching and rewatching them, studying fields and fielders, facing look-alike spinners to get used to the trajectories and lengths, and tuning their muscle-memory. Or rather, they have come planned and prepared to conquer the twirly-men of the sub-continent, buoyed no less by their success in Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well.

Planning and preparation are requisites in taming the spinners, because spin bowling varies in different parts of the world. In Australia, the spinners purchase more bounce and hence batsmen could trust the bounce and play their shots. On wearing surfaces, the ball could leap off a spot or scud along the ground. But not every ball is prone to such fits. The scoring areas are different too; in the sub-continent a lot more runs are scored behind the stumps, through late cuts, sweeps and deflections, whereas in Australia the run-scoring outlets are often in front of the stumps. Worsening their occupation, the nature of turners vary, not just venue-specific but from day-to-day and session-to-session. The turn could be slow and low, or sharp and snappy, the bounce could be true or fickle. A pitch could suddenly slumber and then in the twitch of an eye wake up and emit fire like a hungry dragon.
So the finest overseas players of spin are those that have not only planned and practised but those with a streak of fearlessness and flexibility of mind. Instructive it is to revisit Kevin Pietersen‚Äôs 186 in Mumbai, arguably the most destructive knock in the country by an overseas batsmen. It was the perfect blend of the aforementioned qualities. Pietersen had come planned and prepared, which all competent batsmen at this level do, but the soul of the knock was how he revised his plans and found a way to belt runs.

Between the Ahmedabad (17 and 2) and Mumbai Tests he analysed the reasons for his failings and realised that he was not trusting his defensive technique, which is equally important to succeed in these shores. But when in Mumbai, where it turned and bounced, as opposed to Ahmedabad where the bounce was low and turn slow, he realised that he could not survive just by defending. He counter-attacked in bursts, primarily employing the sweeps, some hit firmly, some dabbed fine, some of the reverse variety. But at the core of his success was that he did not cripple his mind with doubts when the odd ones beat him or when he edged. He was as flexible with his strategies as he was with his body.
Not all batsmen that have succeeded in the sub-continent were Pietersen-like in approach. There are those that grafted and grounded runs, like Alastair Cook, but most of the successful ones this century were stroke-makers like Matthew Hayden, the oft-forgotten Hashim Amla, Michael Clarke, Damyn Martyn and Joe Root. And not all of them were exceptional sweepers ‚Äî Clarke for instance ‚Äî though the sweep has been the most trusted shot for many. Clarke needn‚Äôt because he had nimble feet to glide down the surface. So had Martyn. Root has all the ammo‚Äîsweep, quick feet, soft hands, defensive sturdiness, ability to use the depth of the crease and a deep understanding of a spinners‚Äô mind.
Later, India‚Äôs skipper Rohit Sharma would detail on approaching spinners on turners: ‚ÄúEveryone has their own method, some like to go straight over the head of the bowler. Some sweep, some reverse sweep, things like that. You have to rotate strike, see what are the methods you can score runs off, you have to think on your feet, because bowlers and captains are smart and they keep changing plans and strategies.‚Äù

You also have to choose what shots to play and what not to, against which bowler and when. Like how Pietersen resisted from attempting anything outrageous against Ojha, a tormenter, in the first half of the innings, though in the latter half he did demolish how. Or how Sunil Gavaskar drove Pakistan left-arm spinner Iqbal Qasim only when he strayed into middle and leg and with a full face. When you look at some of the sub-continental batsmen of the past, like VVS Laxman, even when he played against the turn, the ball was met with a full face, before the rubbery wrists kick into action and coax the ball to where his mind whims.
So the real spin test for the Australians would only begin on Thursday, where all that they have imbibed in theory and nets would be put to test, and how effective they are, could decide the outcome of the series. Labuschagne would tell you how difficult it is. In Asia, he averages just 33.33 in seven Tests, a steep dip from his overall average of 59.43, eking out a lone hundred, though that arrived on a Galle minefield. But even after the hundred, he wouldn‚Äôt say that he has vanquished the sub-continent spin demons, because the demons keep spooking back.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia-trial-by-spin-awaits-aussies-8432617/,sports

Speaking about Aamir‚Äôs work ethic, Mushtaq said, ‚ÄúI have done many films with Aamir Khan. In any film, doesn‚Äôt matter who is the director or producer, he is fully involved. The best thing about Aamir Khan is that he wants the film to be good. He wants the scene to be good and he wants that if a scene has four artists they get their moments. For instance, if I have a scene then that will remain my scene. This is a big thing. When it is said that he interferes that‚Äôs not true.‚Äù

Domestic passenger vehicle wholesales rise 2% in June: SIAM,"SoftBank has previously set a PayPay listing as a goal, with one executive saying in November it was worth just under 1 trillion yen ($7.17 billion).","SoftBank is considering a U.S. listing for its PayPay payments business, three sources familiar with the matter said, in what could mark another American listing for Masayoshi Son‚Äôs sprawling tech conglomerate along with chip designer Arm.
New York is seen as a more attractive destination than Tokyo for listings given the higher valuations tech companies generally achieve there, one of the sources said. The timing of the listing was still unclear as money-losing PayPay needs to first demonstrate a clear path to profitability, the source said.
SoftBank has previously set a PayPay listing as a goal, with one executive saying in November it was worth just under 1 trillion yen ($7.17 billion). That the conglomerate is considering a U.S. listing has not been previously reported.

Representatives for PayPay and SoftBank Group‚Äôs domestic telecoms business, SoftBank Corp, said they would not comment on speculation. PayPay is owned by SoftBank Corp, its internet business, Z Holdings, and the group‚Äôs second Vision Fund.
All of the sources declined to be identified as the information is not public.
SoftBank Group shares closed up 2%, with Z Holdings surging almost 6% in their biggest one-day gain since February.
Listings of Japanese companies in New York are rare. Tokyo-based chat app operator Line had a dual listing in 2016 and later merged with SoftBank‚Äôs internet business, with more recent examples including the listing of Syla Technologies in March, according to Dealogic.

‚ÄúZ Holdings shares reacted on hopes that a U.S. listing might invite a premium valuation but recent domestic listings for Rakuten Bank and SBI Sumishin Net Bank indicate there is room for fintech listings locally,‚Äù said analyst Kirk Boodry at Astris Advisory Japan, who values PayPay at 800 billion yen to 900 billion yen.
NARROWING LOSSES
SoftBank founder Son recently pledged to shift to ‚Äúoffence mode‚Äù amid rising global interest and investment in artificial intelligence. He has been playing defence for some time, curbing his investments after the tech sell-off hit the value of his portfolio companies hard.
PayPay, which offers QR code payment services, is used by more than 55 million people in Japan, making it a top player in a crowded digital payments market.

It has benefited from a government-backed effort to encourage consumers to shift towards digital away from cash and grew quickly by offering aggressive rebates.
PayPay booked a loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of 11.9 billion yen in the year ended March, compared to a loss of 43.2 billion yen a year earlier.
The telecoms business is targeting profitability for its financial unit, which includes PayPay, by the year ending March 2026. PayPay is the most widely mobile payment service in Japan, according to a survey of users by Mobile Marketing Data Labo.

"AI unlikely to destroy most jobs, but clerical workers at risk, ILO says",An explosion of interest in generative AI and its chatbot applications has sparked fears over job destruction.,"Generative AI probably will not take over most people‚Äôs jobs entirely but will instead automate a portion of their duties, freeing them up to do other tasks, a U.N. study said on Monday.
It warned, however, that clerical work would likely be the hardest hit, potentially hitting female employment harder, given women‚Äôs over-representation in this sector, especially in wealthier countries.
An explosion of interest in generative AI and its chatbot applications has sparked fears over job destruction, similar to those that emerged when the moving assembly line was introduced in the early 1900s and after mainframe computers in the 1950s.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, the study produced by the International Labour Organization concludes that: ‚ÄúMost jobs and industries are only partially exposed to automation and are thus more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by AI.‚Äù
This means that ‚Äúthe most important impact of the technology is likely to be of augmenting work‚Äù, it adds.
The occupation likely to be most affected by GenAI ‚Äì capable of generating text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models and other data ‚Äì is clerical work, where about a quarter of tasks are highly exposed to potential automation, the study says.
But most other professions, like managers and sales workers, are only marginally exposed, it said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Still, the U.N. agency‚Äôs report warned that the impact of generative AI on affected workers could still be ‚Äúbrutal‚Äù.
‚ÄúTherefore, for policymakers, our study should not read as a calming voice, but rather as a call for harnessing policy to address the technological changes that are upon us,‚Äù it said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-unlikely-to-destroy-most-jobs-but-clerical-workers-at-risk-ilo-says-8903293/,technology

"WPL: Ellyse Perry reveals she‚Äôs always had soft spot for RCB, thanks to ‚Äòtwist of fate‚Äô",Ellyse Perry also called India as the spiritual home of cricket in a lot of senses. ,"Even as she admitted the concept of auctions was ‚Äúweird‚Äù, Australian star Ellyse Perry said it was ‚Äúpretty cool‚Äù to be picked by the Royal Challengers Bangalore side in the Women‚Äôs Premier League auctions. She went on to reveal that she has always had a ‚Äúsoft spot‚Äù in her heart for RCB since she was in the stadium to watch the first game of the men‚Äôs team live in the stadium.
She was picked up by RCB for Rs 1.7 crore earlier this week. 13 of her Australian compatriots were also picked in the WPL auctions. Many of those, like Perry, are currently in South Africa competing in the ICC T20 World Cup.  
‚ÄúA big hello and a big thank you for the opportunity to play with RCB in the first ever WPL,‚Äù Perry told RCB‚Äôs website in a video shot after the auctions. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited for this tournament and everything it means for the women‚Äôs game.  It is kind of really cool because the twist of fate was that I was actually at the first-ever RCB game for men many years ago. Since then, RCB has always had a bit of a soft spot in my heart. I suppose it was this twist of fate and now being part of the first-ever women‚Äôs team is super cool.‚Äù
She also said that the WPL meant more than about the money for them: it was about the growth of the women‚Äôs game.

Of course, remuneration and the chance to earn that kind of money is wonderful, but much larger than that I think is just the general growth of the sport right around the world.‚Äù
She also lauded India as the spiritual home of cricket in a lot of senses.
‚ÄúI think now that women are starting to have a really strong presence in the Indian market and also in the Indian game, that is so much more important than any kind of dollar value that is placed on any player. So from that perspective, the chat was just around wanting to be involved,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOf course, after the auction, those discussions come in about certain value and how much people are sold for, which in itself is a weird kind of concept to swallow. But yeah, I just think it‚Äôs so much bigger than that.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-ellyse-perry-reveals-shes-had-soft-spot-for-rcb-thanks-to-twist-of-fate-8448964/,sports

"After marathon win to qualify for Asian Games, army man Man Singh‚Äôs long, arduous trek to reach home in the hills","Tired of losing at 5000 and 10,000 metres races, Singh turned to marathon and has now clocked the third-fastest time by an Indian.","A day after winning his first-ever marathon at the age of 33, Man Singh travelled seven hours in a state transport bus to Pithoragarh. He then took a shared-taxi to Lumti, where his sister resides, to break the journey. To get home to Kumariyagair village in Bangapani tehsil, Singh has to trek uphill with a heavy army backpack on his shoulders. ‚ÄúIt will take me almost three hours to cover the 10 kilometres. Most of it is through a forest area. Almost as tough as running a marathon,‚Äù Singh jested.
The backpack will be a little heavier too as Singh is carrying sweets to celebrate his New Delhi Marathon win. ‚ÄúIn our village, the first choice of career for men is the Indian army. There are many others who are in the army. But I am the first national-level athlete and first marathon runner from Kumariyagair,‚Äù Singh, a naib subedar, said.
On Sunday, Singh led a trio of army runners in a 1-2-3 finish in the New Delhi marathon. All three ran faster than the Asian Games qualifying norm of the Athletics Federation of India (2:15:00). Singh clocked 2 hours, 14 minutes and 13 seconds with Appachangada Belliappa (2:14.15) snapping at his heels. Karthik Kumar‚Äôs 2:14.19 for third place made this one of the fastest marathons by Indian runners. Singh is now the third fastest-ever, after Shivnath Singh‚Äôs four-decade old national record of 2:12.00 and Olympian Thanackal Gopi‚Äôs 2:13:39.
Sunday was a special day for Singh because it was only his second gold medal in distance running events at a national-level event in seven years. Singh is a 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres specialist who ran in the shadow of Govindan Lakshmanan, the winner of the double gold at the 2017 Asian Championships.
‚ÄúI won the gold in the 5,000 metres at the South Asian Games in 2016. That was my last major gold. But at the South Asian Games Lakshmanan didn‚Äôt participate in the event. I also had to compete against Gopi. Most of the time I was second or third in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres,‚Äù Singh said.
Last year, Singh decided to do something different in his quest to leave behind years of disappointment of being outclassed in races. His training group at the Army Sports Institute in Pune comprised seasoned marathoners like Olympians Nitender Singh Rawat, Gopi and Kheta Ram. Six years ago at the Mumbai Marathon he was one of the pace-setters till 30 kilometres. Back then a thought entered his mind: ‚ÄòIf I am comfortable running 30 kilometers why not try 42.1 kilometres‚Äô.
It took a while for Singh to run his first marathon but the results have been encouraging. Last month at the Mumbai Marathon, his debut marathon, he finished second in the Elite Indian men‚Äôs category clocking (2:16.58).
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúI have been preparing for the marathon for a few months. I was not able to crack the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres in terms of qualifying for big events. The second-place finish in Mumbai gave me confidence that I could do well in the marathon. When I came to Delhi, the weather was ideal for running a marathon. I had a feeling I could meet the qualifying norm for the Asian Games,‚Äù Singh said.
Singh had a sleepless night before the Mumbai Marathon. His biggest worry was whether he would be able to complete the distance of 42.195 kilometres. ‚ÄúWhat if I start to tire after 35-36 kilometres and quit? The other marathon runners had told me how they sort of hit a wall after 35 to 36 kilometres and then it is about mental strength. But I didn‚Äôt give up,‚Äù Singh, who finished second to Gopi, said.
The last two kilometres in New Delhi too was a challenge for Singh. He started to slow down and both Belliappa and Kumar fancied their chances. ‚ÄúBelliappa and I were neck to neck. I had to dip at the finish to edge him out.‚Äù
From hoping to finish on the podium at national events to a medal at this year‚Äôs Asian Games ‚Äì the scale of Singh‚Äôs dreams have grown over the past few months. ‚ÄúNow, I have the belief that I can compete with the best in India and Asia in the marathon. I wanted to be the best in the 5,000m and the 10,000m. That didn‚Äôt happen. So maybe the marathon is the event in which I can fulfil my potential.‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
Singh started running long distances to get physically fit and get selected for army trials, which youngsters in his village aspire for. Before returning home for a short break as an army man-athlete set to compete in the Asian Games, Singh had a lucky break.
The call to his farmer-parents, Sher Singh and mother Muneri Devi connected. ‚ÄúThere could be a phone signal for only a few minutes during a day in Kumariyagair. It is a really remote place, so to talk to the outside world over the phone is at times a small luxury.‚Äù

India mulls green power trade with SE Asia,"On a consolidated net box office basis, the two Friday releases can expect to do `120-140 crore at the box office over the next week or so, say experts.","One movie is bursting with life-size doll houses and blowout parties.

Apple iPhone users can now move Chrome address to bottom: Here‚Äôs how to do it,Tired of stretching your hand to the top of the screen type something in Chrome's address bar? Here's how you can move it to the bottom in a few seconds.,"Google often adds new features and functionalities to its popular internet browser ‚Äì Chrome. Recently, the tech giant added a new option that lets users move the address bar to the bottom of the screen, similar to how it looks on Apple‚Äôs Safari.
Initially spotted earlier this year in a beta version of the browser, the option to move the address to the bottom is now rolling out to everyone on Chrome 119.
By default, Chrome still places the address bar at the top of the screen, meaning you will have to manually move to the bottom. Here‚Äôs how to do it in a few seconds.

You can change the position of the address bar in just one tap. (Express Photo)
1. Open Chrome on your iPhone and long-press on the address bar.
2. Alongside the ‚ÄòCopy Link‚Äô option, you will see a new ‚ÄòMove Address Bar To Bottom‚Äô button. Press on it and the address bar will now appear on the bottom of the screen.
Alternate method
Google also seems to have buried the option in Chrome settings. The alternate method requires users to tap the three-dot menu on the bottom bar and head over to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô.
Now, tap on ‚ÄòAddress Bar‚Äô and you will have the option to move it either to the top or the bottom. Tap on the ‚ÄòDone‚Äô button on the top right and you are good to go.

If the aforementioned options are not available on your iPhone, try updating the Chrome app or wait for some time, since Google seems to be gradually rolling out the feature.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/chrome-bottom-address-bar-iphone-9010334/,technology

"Believe it or not: David Warner might bat right-handed against spinners, according to Fox Sports","The Australian opener‚Äôs record in India, Fox said, is tough reading ‚Äì ""an average of 24.25 across 16 innings (eight Tests across the 2013 and 2017 series). He has three half-centuries with a top score of 71.""","David Warner has reportedly told teammates he will go rightie in the Test ‚Äì likely when coming up against India‚Äôs two left-arm orthodox spinners in Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, according to Fox sports.
‚ÄúDavid Warner is a left-hander. It‚Äôs worth mentioning, since he‚Äôs been spotted in the nets batting right-handed. He‚Äôs reportedly told teammates he will go rightie in the Test ‚Äì likely when coming up against India‚Äôs two left-arm orthodox spinners in Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel,‚Äù Fox wrote.
Calling it a staggering ploy, Fox added that Warner ‚Äúonce batted a full season of junior cricket right-handed and played brilliantly.‚Äù
Warner‚Äôs biggest concern, as per Fox, might not be a left-armer though, with Ravichandwin Ashwin having claimed Warner‚Äôs wicket 10 times in just 15 Tests.
The Australian opener‚Äôs record in India, Fox said, is tough reading ‚Äì ‚Äúan average of 24.25 across 16 innings (eight Tests across the 2013 and 2017 series). He has three half-centuries with a top score of 71.‚Äù
Pitch patch pitter patter continues
Fox wrote earlier: ‚ÄúThe pitch will play a significant factor in Australia‚Äôs selections as a 35-year first looms, while opener David Warner is mulling a shocking switch to potentially bat right-handed in response to the conditions.
Selectively watering parts of the pitch, deploying the roller only in specific areas: India‚Äôs methods of curating the Nagpur pitch have raised plenty of eyebrows in recent days. It appears to be a clear ploy to give bowlers an advantage against left-handed batters ‚Äì with five of Australia‚Äôs top seven lefties, compared to just one Indian batter.‚Äù
While some labelled it ‚Äústraight-up pitch doctoring‚Äù, India great Ravi Shastri hit out at claims his nation was ‚Äòcheating‚Äô by declaring ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bulls**t.
ADVERTISEMENT
Australian cricket journalist Peter Lalor told SEN radio today: ‚ÄúEven in 2004, the wickets weren‚Äôt as extreme as they are these days.
‚ÄúIndia seems more determined every tour to make wickets that are going to make the Aussies uncomfortable, or any visitor uncomfortable.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to say, I‚Äôve never seen a pitch preparation like what they‚Äôve done here in Nagpur.‚Äù
But Australia captain Pat Cummins has tried to downplay the drama, saying the team is ‚Äòembracing the chaos.‚Äô

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs part of the challenge of playing away. Home teams want to win at home. In Australia, we‚Äôre lucky we‚Äôve normally got pace and bounce. Home match advantage, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a terrible thing. It‚Äôs another challenge and makes touring over here even harder when you know the conditions are custom-made for them.‚Äù

"Siraj, Shubman nominated for ICC Player of the Month Award","New Zealand opener Devon Conway, who has had a fine start to the year with three hundreds and two fifties across formats, is the third contender for the award.","India pacer Mohammed Siraj and opener Shubman Gill were on Tuesday nominated for the ICC Player of the Month Award for their stellar show in January.
New Zealand opener Devon Conway, who has had a fine start to the year with three hundreds and two fifties across formats, is the third contender for the award.
Following a fruitful 2022, Gill displayed his batting prowess in both the white-ball formats last month while Siraj led India‚Äôs fast-bowling attack with distinction in ODIs in recent times, showcasing his brilliance consistently, especially with the new ball in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah. Gill was handed his maiden T20I cap in the first match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, where he managed just seven, before another single-digit score in the second game. He made a steady 46 in the third T20I in Rajkot.
Gill then registered scores of 70, 21 and 116 in the three ODIs against the island nation, but it was his breathtaking display in the first ODI against New Zealand in Hyderabad that stole the show.
The 23-year-old struck 208 off 149 balls in an incredible knock on a day when none of his teammates crossed 28.
Gill got to 200 with three consecutive sixes off Lockie Ferguson, and with it, became the youngest player to the milestone in ODIs.
He backed that up with scores of 40 not out and 112 in his next two outings to close out the series with an aggregate of 360, the joint-highest for anyone in a three-match ODI series, equalling Babar Azam‚Äôs record against the West Indies in 2016-17.
ADVERTISEMENT
Siraj‚Äôs incredible form, on the other hand, was rewarded in the ICC Men‚Äôs Player Rankings, where he was crowned the No.1 bowler in ODIs.
He returned with figures of 2/30 from seven overs in a high-scoring first ODI against Sri Lanka in Guwahati and backed it up with figures of 3/30 and 4/32 in his next two outings respectively to finish as the leading wicket-taker in the series.

Sebi proposes keeping intermediaries away from ‚Äòfinfluencers‚Äô,The Sebi consultation paper comes amid a rise in the number of unregistered investment advisors giving out stock tips on social media platforms.,"Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Friday proposed that intermediaries should dissociate themselves from unregistered financial influencers, also known as ‚Äúfinfluencers‚Äù.
The Sebi consultation paper comes amid a rise in the number of unregistered investment advisors giving out stock tips on social media platforms.
‚ÄúNo SEBI registered intermediaries or regulated entities or their agents or representatives shall, directly or indirectly, have any association or relationship in any form, whether monetary or non-monetary, for any promotion or advertisement of their services or products, with any unregistered entities (including finfluencers),‚Äù Sebi said in the consultation paper.
ADVERTISEMENT
The paper said SEBI-registered intermediaries should take active measures to dissociate themselves from any unregistered entity using their name, product or service.
Finfluencers are usually unregistered entities providing catchy content, information, and advice on various financial topics to several followers. While some of them may be genuine educators, many of them are unauthorised investment advisers or research analysts.
The paper proposed that entities registered or regulated by Sebi, stock exchanges or the Association of Mutual Funds in India should not share confidential information of their clients with unregistered entities.
It said that registered finfluencers should display their appropriate registration number, contact details, investor grievance redressal helpline, and make appropriate disclosure and disclaimer on any posts.
ADVERTISEMENT
Besides undertaking enforcement action against unregistered finfluencers who breach SEBI regulations, the paper also proposed to disrupt the revenue model for such finfluencers, so that the perverse incentives in the ecosystem are reduced.
‚ÄúSEBI registered intermediaries or regulated entities will not pay any trailing commission based on the number of referrals as referral fee,‚Äù it said.
In a separate consultation paper, released on Friday, the markets regulator proposed to create a closed ecosystem for fee collection by its registered IAs and RAs from their clients. The ecosystem will help investors ensure that their payments are reaching only registered IAs and RAs.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúIt will also instil confidence among investors that fees are being paid to a SEBI registered IA/ RA and will motivate them to approach only registered IAs/RAs for all their investment advisory/research service needs,‚Äù it said.
The details of the mechanism for fee collection shall be disclosed by IAs and RAs to their clients and shall form part of the client agreement, the draft paper said.
The regulator has sought public comment on both the consultation papers by September 15, 2023.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sebi-proposes-intermediaries-stay-away-from-finfluencers-8909724/,business

Who is the Australian offspinner Todd Murphy set to debut at Nagpur Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy? ,A chance encounter with spin coach Craig Howard at a U-16 trail changed Murphy from a medium pacer to an offspinner and sent him on his way to a surprise call-up to Australian Test team,"The bespectacled 22-year old Australian spinner Todd Murphy has said that he was ‚Äúbit surprised‚Äù by his call-up to the Test squad for the India series but the offspinner, who has just played seven first-class games, could turn out to be the wildcard surprise of the tour, if people close to him are to be believed.
It was the spin coach Craig Howard, a contemporary legspinner of Shane Warne and who is now the spin coach of New Zealand women team, who first spotted Murphy at a fortunate encounter at a U-16 trial.
Before we go into the past, here is Howard‚Äôs assessment on Murphy the spinner. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very well set up to bowl with a high overspun seam position, which in Australian conditions it‚Äôs imperative that you beat people in the air rather than trying to beat them off the wicket,‚Äù Howard told Cricket Australia. ‚ÄúThe most difficult conditions (for spinners) is Australian conditions; non-abrasive conditions are the most challenging because you‚Äôve really got to beat people in the air. And he certainly can do that, so adapting to highly abrasive conditions is a lot easier than trying to do it the other way.‚Äù
Post his selection, Murphy has been picking up tips about bowling in India from Steve Keefe, the spinner who stunned India in the Pune Test in 2017.
‚ÄúHe spins up at the back of the ball, which means he‚Äôs going to get a lot of drop. He‚Äôs going to get a lot of bounce and in the right condition, spin,‚Äù Keef told SMH. Murphy made his first-class debut for Victoria in April 2021 and has captured 29 wickets averaging 25.2.

Howard was at the small town of Rochester in Victoria to watch his son trial at the U-16 camp when he spotted a 16-year old Murphy bowling off spin. Impressed, Howard enquired about Murphy and was told: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a batter that bowls a bit of medium pace, he‚Äôs just stuffing around‚Äù. ‚ÄúAnd I actually said, ‚Äòhe‚Äôs your best spinner‚Äô just off the cuff a little bit,‚Äù Howard said.
Howard then watched Murphy bowl in couple of games; by then Murphy had started to bowl more offspin. His style was ‚Äúa little bit awkward, his strategies were a little bit different‚Äù. Howard then had a word with Murphy‚Äôs father Jamie, who has also played cricket, and had him send the son to him for some private spin coaching lessons ‚Äì ‚ÄúJust to try and tidy up a little bit‚Äù.

Murphy would play a full season with Sandhurst Cricket Club in Bendigo, where Howard was based, and the spin bowling technique began to be formalised. ‚Äúwe worked consistently all through the year on getting him technically set up and then playing with him I was able to guide him tactically as well,‚Äù Howard says.
Murphy has talked about how he never enjoyed bowling medium pace and his stint with Howard set up his career.
‚ÄúI never really enjoyed bowling medium pace at training,‚Äù Murphy told Cricket.com.au.‚ÄùSo I kept tinkering with (off-spin) and then for me it was like ‚Äòwhy not, why can‚Äôt I do it? The medium pace was never going to take me anywhere. So being open to changing and really enjoying learning about off-spin bowling and having Craig there to talk to was awesome.‚Äù
Speaking to Sportstar, ahead of the India series, Murphy picked the 2008 game at Sydney, in the infamous monkey-gate series involving Harbhajan Singh, as his favourite India-Australia game.

Finn Allen experiment is failing; look at the way Rohit Sharma plays: Former Kiwi opener Cumming,The cricketer had made his 50-over debut last year with a few impressive scores against Ireland and the West Indies but has quickly gone into a downward spiral. ,"Former New Zealand cricketer Craig Cumming is unhappy with head coach Gary Stead‚Äôs persistence with opener Finn Allen, who failed with the bat in the recently-concluded three-match ODI series against India.
The hosts whitewashed the Kiwis 3-0 with Allen, 23, scoring two consecutive ducks and a 40, raising doubts about his selection in the New Zealand side with the ODI World Cup in India less than nine months away.
The cricketer had made his 50-over debut last year with a few impressive scores against Ireland and the West Indies but has quickly gone into a downward spiral.

‚ÄúFinn Allen at the moment, he‚Äôs young, he‚Äôs learning but (he‚Äôs in a) really important position for us at the top of the order and he seems to be at the moment a one-pace, one-line hitter.

‚ÄúYou look at Rohit Sharma and the way they (India) play, yes they‚Äôre powerful but they also have skill in the way they go about executing their plans.

"AI could imperil salaries, not jobs; Why findings of new ECB study contrast with outcomes of previous tech waves","In general white-collar workers, and workers in advanced economies in general, are projected to be at a greater risk than blue collar workers in developing countries.","Waves of innovation in artificial intelligence have revived the debate on the impact of new technologies on employment. And while the jury is still out on how these newer innovations will play out, new research published by the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank (ECB) has said the adoption of AI could reduce wages, but so far is creating, not devouring jobs. But there are caveats: the conclusion of this latest Europe-focused study is more pronounced in the category of the young and highly-skilled workers in what is clearly a developed market setting, with the paper primarily looking at the deep learning boom of the 2010s.
The conclusion here is that occupations potentially more exposed to AI-enabled technologies actually increased their employment share in Europe and that jobs with a relatively higher proportion of younger and skilled workers gained the most. For salaries, it said that the evidence is ‚Äúless clear and suggests neutral to slightly negative impacts‚Äù. ‚ÄúThese results do not amount to an acquittal,‚Äù the paper noted. ‚ÄúAI-enabled technologies continue to be developed and adopted. Most of their impact on employment and wages ‚Äì and therefore on growth and equality ‚Äì has yet to be seen,‚Äù said the paper published by the ECB in a Research that was authored by Stefania Albanesi of the University of Pittsburgh and the NBER, and others.

Midjourney introduces image inpainting feature: Here‚Äôs what it means,The new feature essentially allows users to select specific portions of an image and edit them via text prompts.,"When it comes to images and artworks, Artificial Intelligence is getting better with each passing day. With Midjourney, creators are finding newer ways to produce imaginative artworks. Now, the popular AI-powered image generator has added yet another interesting feature to its model. 
The new upgrade will let creators paint-by-prompt with its new feature, something which AI art creators have been eagerly looking forward to. This feature allows creators to edit upscaled images simply by editing the text prompt. Known as Vary Region, the feature lets users select and alter an area of an artwork with new words. This, according to experts, allows greater freedom for creators.

In simple words, the Vary Region feature lets users select specific sections of an image and modify them with the help of text prompts. Besides, the tool also endows the user with the ability to add elements like adding accessories to a portrait ‚Äì this is what is known as inpainting.
ADVERTISEMENT
Midjourney states that the inpainting feature works ideally with large edits ‚Äì 20 to 50 per cent of the image. However, it will struggle to change or replace small details in the background. With the latest update creators need not wait for the final render, they can prompt-paint to perfect their image. 
Also Read | Stability AI unveils powerful image generator SDXL 1.0, its rival to Midjourney
It is to be noted that the inpainting feature works best when the prompt change is in sync with and complements the original image. Midjourney claimed that inpainting is not a magic fix. The feature creates new images based on the original image and a customised prompt.
Midjourney‚Äôs competitor Stable Diffusion, a free open-source image generator, already offers functions such as inpainting and outpainting.

"Orry opens up about equation with Sara Ali Khan after being rumoured to have slammed her online: ‚ÄòWe were best friends in college, ew‚Äô","Orry addressed the rumours of his feud with Sara Ali Khan during a recent AMA session on Reddit, and said that they drifted apart despite being best friends in college.","Internet sensation Orry, aka Orhan Awatramani, spilled the tea about Bollywood celebrities in a recent AMA session on Reddit. He answered questions about attending Shah Rukh Khan‚Äôs grand 58th birthday party recently, and also spoke about his several star-kid friends, such as Suhana Khan, Janhvi Kapoor and Nysa Devgan. But Orry also took the time to clear the air about a rumoured feud between him and actor Sara Ali Khan, that gained steam on Reddit itself a few months ago. Orry praised Sara‚Äôs work ethic, and called her a dedicated actor both on an off the screen.
Orry was rumoured to have repeatedly slammed Sara via a decoy account on Reddit, questioning her efforts to appeal to middle India, and criticising her skills as an actor. On Christmas, however, Orry gave a long answer when asked about his ‚Äòequation with Sara‚Äô. He said, ‚ÄúLet me tell you something about Sara Ali Khan, we were best friends in college ü§¢ewü§ÆI know right ?

28% GST stays on online gaming and casinos but review after six months,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the decision was not taken with consensus, as had happened at the time of the GST change on lottery, with some states registering dissent but most states asking for early implementation of the decision taken at the last Council meeting.","Although some states differed on the valuation norms and tax levy on online gaming and casinos, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, in its 51st meeting via videoconferencing Wednesday, decided to levy 28 per cent tax at face value at entry level.
The Council, however, gave some relief by deciding not to impose the tax levy on the amount entered into games/bets out of winnings of previous games/bets in online money gaming or on total value of each bet placed, as would be the case in casinos.
Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the decision was not taken with consensus, as had happened at the time of the GST change on lottery, with some states registering dissent but most states asking for early implementation of the decision taken at the last Council meeting.

In its previous meeting on July 11, the GST Council had decided to levy a uniform 28 per cent tax on full face value for online gaming, casinos and horse racing.

The new tax levy is now expected to be effective from October 1. A review would be undertaken after six months of the implementation, Sitharaman, who heads the Council, said.
‚ÄúThe valuation may be done based on the amount paid or payable or deposited with the supplier by or on behalf of the player, excluding the amount entered into games bets out of winnings of previous games and bets, and not on the total value of each bets placed‚Ä¶ (GST will be on) entry (level) whatever they pay to get chips and not what they pay in each game,‚Äù she said.
VIDEO | ‚ÄúThe council agreed today to come back after six months to review the way in which this (28 per cent GST rates on casinos and online gaming) is getting implemented,‚Äù says Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman after 51st GST Council Meeting. pic.twitter.com/opqWTTMbTc
‚Äî Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) August 2, 2023
Citing remarks shared by the Meghalaya Chief Minister at the Council meeting, she also pointed out that the prevailing practice is of 18 per cent GST on gross gaming revenue or platform fee, which results in net revenue of only 8-9 per cent.
‚ÄúAssuming today‚Äôs 18 per cent on GGR becomes 28 per cent on GGR, we will be collecting only around 11-12 per cent‚Ä¶ at the current collections, it is far lesser than the tax we levy on some of the essential goods for households. This is gaming, you are wagering on it,‚Äù she said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Giving an example, she said if a bet is placed for say Rs 1,000, and the player wins Rs 300, and if the player again places a bet of Rs 1,300, then GST will not be levied on the winning amount of Rs 300.
Officials would now work on the legal amendments, which are expected to be taken up in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, following which states will also pass respective amendments in the state GST laws.
‚ÄúWhen the question of when to implement it came, October 1 is when it is expected, by which time the states will also pass the amendments to their state laws‚Ä¶ because of the casinos, Goa and Sikkim kept appealing saying that they are small states and need to be given some consideration‚Ä¶ The Council agreed today to come back after six months to review the way in which this is getting implemented. When I say six months, it‚Äôs not six months from today but six months from when this gets implemented,‚Äù Sitharaman said.
ADVERTISEMENT
At least three states recorded their dissent during the Council meeting, with Delhi having asked for a complete review for online gaming. Goa and Sikkim asked for GST to be levied on gross gaming revenue even as they supported a higher 28 per cent rate, Sitharaman said.
Tamil Nadu, which has already banned online gaming, also asked for the legal amendment to take the ban into account such that online gaming does not become taxable in the state.
Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra said that Tamil Nadu had some issues which will be resolved with them.
‚ÄúIt should not happen that by making these changes, online gaming also becomes legal. So we told them that betting is already liable to GST today in the Act. That does not make betting legal, if it is illegal, which it is. Betting and gambling are illegal in the country, other than horse racing and some specific cases‚Ä¶ if betting and gambling are illegal but still liable to tax, just by including online gaming within the purview of the Act and making them liable to tax will not result in legalising online gaming in their state if they have banned it or they have made it illegal,‚Äù he said.
Other states such as Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Bihar asked the Council to implement its decision from the last meeting at the earliest, Sitharaman said.

Offshore gaming platforms will have to register themselves with the GST authorities, Malhotra said, adding that in case they do not follow the law, the government will invoke the provisions of the Information Technology Act to block those sites. Any payments through virtual digital assets will also attract the GST rate of 28 per cent.
Meanwhile, the Centre filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, challenging the recent Karnataka High Court ruling that quashed a Rs 21,000-crore show-cause tax notice issued to Bengaluru-based Gameskraft Technology Private Ltd (GTPL). The Revenue Secretary said a 28% tax on online gaming was always there and the Council is just clarifying the position and they would go by the Court decision on the matter.

A joint statement by The Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports and E-Gaming Federation said, ‚ÄúFIFS & EGF, which represent 50 Indian online gaming companies, appreciate the Government addressing the industry‚Äôs concerns on the issue of repeat taxation. The new tax framework, while clarifying and resolving uncertainty, will lead to a very burdensome 350% increase in GST and set the Indian online gaming industry back several years. However, it will allow gaming companies a fighting chance to innovate and rebuild the foundation of gaming in India.‚Äù",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/28-gst-on-online-gaming-effective-from-oct-1-review-next-year-fm-sitharaman-8873549/,business

India considers wheat imports from Russia at discount to calm prices: Report,"India is in talks with Russia to import wheat at a discount to surging global prices in a rare move to boost supplies and curb food inflation ahead of state and national elections next year, reported Reuters.","India is in talks with Russia to import wheat at a discount to surging global prices in a rare move to boost supplies and curb food inflation ahead of state and national elections next year, according to four sources.
The imports would allow New Delhi to intervene more effectively in the market to drive down wheat prices that stoked inflation to a 15-month high in July.
‚ÄúThe government is exploring the possibility of imports through private trade and government-to-government deals. The decision will be made cautiously,‚Äù one of the sources told Reuters, when asked about wheat imports from Russia.
ADVERTISEMENT
India has not imported wheat through diplomatic deals in years. The last time India imported a significant amount of wheat was in 2017, when private traders shipped in 5.3 million metric tons.
The government‚Äôs plan to import Russian wheat is one of the supply-side measures being considered to bring down prices of key commodities like fuel, cereals and pulse along with an extension of rural schemes to ease the impact of inflation on the poor, two of the sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Sources did not want to be named as the discussions are private and the final decision might be weeks away. India‚Äôs finance, trade and government spokespersons did not reply to emails and messages seeking comment.
Last month, Sanjeev Chopra, the most senior civil servant at the federal food ministry, said there was no proposal to import wheat from Russia.
LOW WHEAT STOCKS
ADVERTISEMENT
Although India needs only 3 million to 4 million metric tons of wheat to plug the shortfall, New Delhi might consider importing 8 million to 9 million tons of wheat from Russia to have a far bigger impact on prices, another source said.
Since the war in Ukraine last year, Russia has become India‚Äôs second biggest seller of goods mainly on account of discounted oil purchases by New Delhi.
‚ÄúRussia has indicated its willingness to offer a discount on prevailing market prices. There are no restrictions on the export of food commodities from Russia,‚Äù one official said.
ADVERTISEMENT
India is also importing sunflower oil from Russia and settling payments in U.S. dollars and is planning to use the same approach, the official added.
‚ÄúIndia can easily secure a discount of $25 to $40 per ton from Russia. This will ensure that the landed cost of wheat remains significantly below local prices,‚Äù said a dealer based in Mumbai with a global trade house.
Wholesale wheat prices in India surged around 10% over two months to a seven-month high in August on limited supplies.
Wheat stocks at government warehouses were at 28.3 million tons on Aug. 1, 20% below the 10-year average.
Last year, India banned wheat exports due to lower output, and this year‚Äôs crop is also expected to be at least 10% lower than the government‚Äôs estimate.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-wheat-imports-russia-discount-prices-8896566/,business
Automobile retail sales see 9% growth in August: FADA,"Automobile retail sales in India rose by 9 per cent in August aided by sales growth in all segments, including passenger vehicles and two wheelers, dealers' body FADA said on Tuesday.","Automobile retail sales in India rose by 9 per cent in August aided by sales growth in all segments, including passenger vehicles and two wheelers, dealers‚Äô body FADA said on Tuesday.
The total retail sales across segments rose to 18,18,647 units last month, up 9 per cent, from 16,74,162 units in August 2022.
Passenger vehicle registrations increased by 7 per cent to 3,15,153 units last month from 2,95,842 units in August 2022.

‚ÄúIn the passenger vehicle segment, improved vehicle supply, bolstered by expanded customer schemes, has maintained positive market dynamics,‚Äù the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) President Manish Raj Singhania said in a statement.
Similarly, two-wheeler sales saw a jump of 6 per cent to 12,54,444 units as compared with 11,80,230 units in the same month last year.
‚ÄúDespite positive growth, consumer sentiment remained ambivalent, impacting conversion rates and intensifying competition among key players,‚Äù Singhania noted.
Commercial vehicle registrations increased by 3 per cent to 75,294 units last month from 72,940 units in the same month last year.

Tractor sales jumped 14 per cent to 73,849 units in August as against 65,018 units in the year-ago period.
Three-wheeler retail sales saw a jump of 66 per cent to 99,907 units in August from 60,132 units in August 2022.
‚ÄúAs the Indian automobile industry enters September, the outlook remains cautiously optimistic, shaped by a multitude of factors that vary across vehicle segments,‚Äù Singhania said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The onset of the festive season, beginning with Onam, has uplifted market mood, improved liquidity and eased earlier bottlenecks in the supply chain across all categories, he added.
Lack of sufficient rainfall could precipitate a rise in inflation, adversely affecting consumer purchasing power and diminishing demand, Singhania stated.
This meteorological shortfall would not only jeopardise the yield of the ongoing kharif crops but also cast a shadow on the subsequent sowing season for rabi crops, he added.
‚ÄúSuch developments would be particularly inopportune as they would coincide with the peak of India‚Äôs festive season, notably Navratri and Deepawali, traditionally periods of heightened consumer activity,‚Äù Singhania said.

This is equivalent to 5.4 per cent of the total revenue collected by all states and UTs in India during 2022-23, it added.
‚ÄúReal estate sector is one of the key contributors to the revenue of state governments. In FY 2022-23, an estimated Rs 2 trillion was collected by all states and UTs (Union Territories) in India from stamp duties, registration fees and land revenue,‚Äù the report said.

Realtors‚Äô body Naredco and property consultant Knight Frank India recently released a report ‚ÄòIndia Real Estate: Vision 2047‚Äô.
As per the projection of the report, the size of the Indian real estate sector is estimated to jump more than 12-fold to USD 5.8 trillion by 2047 from USD 477 billion last year. The sector will contribute over 15 per cent to the total economic output of the country in 2047 from an existing share of 7.3 per cent.
By 2047, when India reaches 100 years of independence, the size of the economy is estimated to be USD 33-40 trillion. For study purposes, Knight Frank has taken the mean estimated growth of the Indian economy at USD 36.4 trillion by 2047.

Shishir Baijal, Chairman and MD, Knight Frank India said, ‚ÄúThe robust price trend in the upper end of the market coupled with strong sales momentum has elevated Mumbai‚Äôs position in this global ranking scale. Sales momentum is significantly stronger in the higher ticket sizes today, than it has been in the past five years.‚Äù

India explores developing strategic gas stockpile as hedge against volatility,Gupta said it is important for people to understand that there will not be quick money and that proper procedures and checks will be followed before actual funding.,"Business reality show Shark Tank India judge and boAt co-founder Aman Gupta has asserted that due diligence is and will continue to be an integral part of funding startups amid the controversy and allegations of delayed funding even after deals are struck on the show.
Gupta said it is important for people to understand that there will not be quick money and that proper procedures and checks will be followed before actual funding.
‚ÄúIf someone thinks it‚Äôs easy money‚Ä¶that rich businessmen are cutting cheques, this was a misconception that has been cleared,‚Äù Gupta told PTI in an interview.

He said that he and other ‚Äòsharks‚Äô earned their money through hard work and grit, and asserted that proper procedures of checks will be followed.
‚ÄúWe have earned the money with hard work and we will not just give our money without due diligence,‚Äù Gupta said.
Shark Tank India has done beautiful things for the country, bringing entrepreneurship and startups into dinner table conversations.
Today, families come together to watch the show, he said.
Responding to charges around delayed investments and not keeping up with commitments and promises made on the show, Gupta said, ‚ÄúIt is not delayed funding‚Ä¶it is a regular course of funding and for every entrepreneur it takes time‚Äù.

He contended that during boAt‚Äôs first capital raise, the talks were initiated in 2016 but the funding came in 2018.
‚ÄúIn one hour, no one gets a cheque. There is a due diligence process and when we fund companies‚Ä¶there are companies which are not even formed‚Ä¶Governance aspects have to be checked‚Ä¶whether whatever the founder said on the show is right or wrong‚Ä¶we also don‚Äôt want to invest in a company where we find later that the founder is a fraud,‚Äù he said.
Gupta said he is glad that the misconceptions are being cleared before the show‚Äôs next season.

Decay of heaviest oxygen isotope casts shadow on physicists‚Äô understanding of nuclear stability,"Both 28O and 27O were found to be generated when thick liquid hydrogen was bombarded with intense beams of 29F (flourine-29 isotope), having unstable nuclei, from a particle accelerator at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope (RI) Beam Factory, Japan.","Heaviest oxygen isotope was observed to quickly decay and challenge physicists‚Äô understanding of nuclear forces, scientists report in a study published in the journal Nature.
Isotopes are elements sharing the same atomic number but differing in their atomic weights.
Atomic number is equal to protons in the atom‚Äôs nucleus, whereas atomic weight comes from the protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons and bound by strong nuclear forces, in the nucleus.
ADVERTISEMENT
The most commonly available form of oxygen, 16O, has 8 protons (atomic number 8) and 8 neutrons in its nucleus and thus, has an atomic weight of 16.
Its isotopes, oxygen-28 and oxygen-27, have the same protons (8), but differ in the number of neutrons, which is 20 and 19, respectively.
The neutron-rich isotopes, oxygen-28 (28O) and oxygen-27 (27O), were observed as they were in the process of decaying into oxygen-24 (8 protons, 16 neutrons), after emitting 4 and 3 neutrons, respectively, and thus, proving to be neutron-unbound, the international team of researchers led by Yosuke Kondo, assistant professor at the Department of Physics at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, said in their study.

The nucleus 28O was of significant interest as it was expected to be one of the few ‚Äòdoubly magic‚Äô nuclei in the standard shell-model picture of nuclear structure, they said.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the nuclear shell-model, a shell inside a nucleus filled up with just the right number or ‚Äòmagic number‚Äô of nucleons results in strong binding forces. These numbers are thought to include 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126 particles.
The most abundant form of oxygen, having 8 protons and 8 neutrons, is considered ‚Äòdoubly magic‚Äô.
However, the decay of 28O, with 8 protons and 20 neutrons and initially thought of as ‚Äòdoubly magic‚Äô, has challenged scientists‚Äô understanding of principles governing nuclear forces.
Both 28O and 27O were found to be generated when thick liquid hydrogen was bombarded with intense beams of 29F (flourine-29 isotope), having unstable nuclei, from a particle accelerator at the RIKEN Radioactive Isotope (RI) Beam Factory, Japan. The incident beam knocked out a proton from the liquid hydrogen‚Äôs nucleus, thereby generating 28O.
ADVERTISEMENT
The researchers observed these isotopes and studied their properties by directly detecting their decay products.
Further, they found that the existence of these isotopes was very short-lived, as they decayed through spontaneous neutron emission.
The present findings enhance our understanding of nuclear structure (and forces) by offering new insights, especially for extremely neutron-rich nuclei, the researchers said.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/heavy-oxygen-isotope-decay-8919537/,technology

While that was an upgrade from 2.7% in the OECD‚Äôs June outlook, global growth was expected to slow to 2.7% in 2024 ‚Äì down from its estimate of 2.9% in June.

The Paris-based body said it now expected the U.S. economy to grow 2.2% this year rather than the 1.6% it forecast in June as U.S growth proves more resilient than most economists expected in the face of a series of rate hikes.
Nonetheless, it was likely to slow next year to 1.3%, though that was better than the 1.0% for 2024 expected in June.
The improved U.S. outlook for this year helped offset weakness in China and the euro zone, dragged down by Germany ‚Äì the only major economy expected to be in recession.
The OECD forecast that the Chinese economy would slow from 5.1% this year to 4.6% next year as momentum from the end of COVID restrictions fades and the property market struggles. In June, the OECD had forecast 5.4% growth this year and 5.1% next year.
ADVERTISEMENT
The OECD cut the euro zone‚Äôs growth outlook this year to just 0.6% from 0.9% in June, but forecast it would pick up next year to 1.1% ‚Äì down from 1.5% in June ‚Äì as Germany returned to growth.
Though the growth outlook for next year would mostly be weak, the OECD said central banks should keep interest rates high until clear signs inflationary pressures have subsided.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/oecd-raises-2023-global-growth-outlook-cuts-for-2024-8946776/,business

Latest Arsenal-Man United clash could herald the return of Premier League‚Äôs original rivalry,"Both clubs fell off their perch over the last decade, but Sunday‚Äôs showdown could have a major bearing on title race","There was a time not too long ago when to be an Arsenal faithful meant that you hated Manchester United, and to be a Manchester United diehard meant that you detested Arsenal. This was the Premier League‚Äôs original and genuine rivalry, pure and fierce, natural and organic, unstained by history and untroubled by the proximity of arenas, a rivalry borne out of sheer competitiveness. It was part of the package that made Premier League weekends a blockbuster in India at the turn of the century, when European football was yet to entrench into the psyche and commercial spaces of the country. Without this rivalry, perhaps league football would have never dug its roots and spread its shadows in the country.

Peak United-Arsenal encounters were a multi-layered spectacle, a one-on-one bout that unfurled multiple dimensions and narratives. The storylines were so many that it matched El Clasico, a bust-up between two legendary managers, two visionaries who lifted the standards of Premier League football, one from the shipyards of Govan and the other from the vineyards of Alsace, one who had apprenticeship as a toolmaker at a factory in Hillington, and the other with a Masters degree in Economics. No managers have defined the Premier League as much as Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger, the former farewelling his club in 2013 and latter five years later.

‚ÄúBut if you are not looking that age and you are looking the part, they will. We are already seeing that women are offered some really meaty roles and they are coming into their own. So, it‚Äôs a great time for us.‚Äù Indian Police Force is described as an ode to the selfless service, unconditional commitment and fierce patriotism of police officers across the country.

Carolina Marin fan Adita Rao overcomes injury to enter semifinals of badminton nationals,"Competing against doctor‚Äôs orders, Adita Rao beats Ira Sharma to set up clash with favourite Aakarshi Kashyap","Back in December when in practice ahead of the junior nationals, Adita Rao twisted her leg, hurt a ligament and suffered a side strain. The trauma was fresh, and the worrying about aggravating it persistent. Yet, there is the natural speed in her feet ‚Äì honed in the last six months, but perhaps inherited from her athlete mother ‚Äì that has propelled her into the semifinals of the Badminton Senior Nationals at Balewadi.
It was the foot-speed that helped her negate the big game of the talented and fit Ira Sharma in the quarterfinals, as she made a surprise run into the last four alongside Aakarshi Kashyap, Ashmita Chaliha and Anupama Upadhyay. Reading her opponent‚Äôs game and using her own quick reach at the net with an effective lunge, Adita, seeded third, would win in straight games 21-16, 21-15.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/carolina-marin-fan-adita-rao-overcomes-injury-to-enter-semifinals-of-badminton-nationals-8468193/,sports

First priority is to get 100 percent fit: Jadeja,"Very excited. Hopefully it will come good as a team and as an individual also,"" Jadeja, who will lead Saurashtra in their final Ranji Trophy Group B league match against Tamil Nadu beginning here on Tuesday, told reporters.","Star India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who is making a return to competitive cricket after close to six months, on Monday said his first priority is to get ‚Äú100 percent‚Äù match fit ahead of the crucial Test series against Australia. ‚ÄúI am feeling good to be back on the field.
Very excited. Hopefully it will come good as a team and as an individual also,‚Äù Jadeja, who will lead Saurashtra in their final Ranji Trophy Group B league match against Tamil Nadu beginning here on Tuesday, told reporters.
‚Äú‚Ä¶See my first priority is to get on the field and be fit‚Ä¶100 per cent fit. Once I am 100 per cent fit, I will work more on my skills, whether it is batting or bowling. Now, my first priority is fitness‚Ä¶‚Äù Jadeja had to undergo a knee surgery last year after playing for India last in August.
He said he had spent time at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru and added that he wanted game time before the Test series against the visiting Australians.
‚ÄúI was at the NCA for 20 days. I was doing batting and bowling. Match scenario is different. I wanted one game before the Australia series, that‚Äôs why I am here.‚Äù He has been picked in the India squad for the first two Tests subject to fitness.
When asked if there was any discomfort now, Jadeja said: ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶after five months I am playing competitive cricket, so you don‚Äôt feel confident initially. ‚ÄúBut as you progress, then definitely you get better and better. Injury is part of any sport. If you get injured, you have to start from scratch. The same thing in cricket.
‚ÄúI was out of action for 5 months. I have to build my fitness. Once I get the confidence, I will definitely work on my skills and I will get better day by day.‚Äù He mentioned that it probably was his longest time out of the game.
‚ÄúI think so‚Ä¶because of surgery.‚Äù
Jadeja revealed it was a ligament tear.

‚ÄúYou feel bad. Nobody wants to get injured at your peak time. It is part of the game. You have to keep that in mind and be prepared for it. You can‚Äôt do anything. There is no guarantee that one won‚Äôt get injured in cricket.
‚ÄúIt was a ligament tear. It is coming good. I am slowly getting confident.‚Äù Jadeja emphasised that though he had been practising at the NCA, a match is a different ball game.
‚ÄúAs I said, a match is a different thing. Different ball game‚Ä¶I will try to give my 100 per cent. I will try to go slowly, slowly. Let‚Äôs see how my leg is feeling and then we will see.‚Äù With star keeper-batter Rishabh Pant expected to be out of action for a considerable time after being involved in a road mishap last month, the focus would be on the player to don the big gloves in the Tests against the Aussies and Jadeja gave both Srikar Bharat and Ishan Kishan a thumbs up for the role. ‚ÄúI am comfortable with everyone. First, I need to be comfortable‚Ä¶(laughs) They both are very good keepers. Srikar Bharat is coming into the squad now. He has to learn a lot of things. He will learn and get better and better as he plays more number of games,‚Äù Asked how challenging it was mentally to return to full fitness, the ace all-rounder said, ‚ÄúActually, fortunately I was busy with some other things‚Ä¶It helped me a lot.

Chess player expelled for using mobile phone in toilet,"Mihalache found using Chess Apps on a mobile phone hidden in toilet, faces FIDE disciplinary charges","Paul-Stelian Mihalache, a player with a FIDE rating of 1698, has been expelled from Romanian Chess Championship after a mobile phone was found in his restroom. The issue has been brought to the notice of the FIDE‚Äôs disciplinary commission and the player faces a ban for a certain period of time.
During the fifth round of the Romanian Championship, a nine-round Swiss tournament currently underway in Sebes, Mihalache showed suspicious behavior which included frequent visits to the restroom.
After one of his frequent visits, an arbiter decided to check one of the toilet cubicles where a smart phone was found. The phone, which was left unlocked, had three chess apps on it with one showing Mihalache‚Äôs game after 15 moves with the engine Stockfish 15 runnings. A Google account with Mihalache‚Äôs name and email address was also active on the phone.
Right through the tournament a special anti-cheating officer has been doing random checks before and during the matches on players using metal detectors. After the phone was found, Mihalache was subjected to an inspection in a separate room, but no devices were found. And confronted with the information about the smart phone found in the washroom which had his Google account and the Chess app, the player denied it was his. However, he did sign the scoresheet which declared he lad lost the game.
Such incidents are not new in Chess. In 2015, Georgian grandmaster Gaioz Nigalidze was found using iPod at the Dubai Open and was expelled from the tournament. He even ended up losing his GM tag.
And more recently, Magnus Carlsen had found Hans Niemann‚Äôs behaviour to be suspicious and pulled-out of a tournament.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/chess/chess-player-paul-stelian-mihalache-expelled-for-using-mobile-phone-in-toilet-8463846/,sports

In another scene, he is seen carrying a lathi, which has led the speculation that the actor is playing a college professor in the film. Before we decide on that, he has shifted to holding a gun.

Tesla will start making new EV model in second half of 2025,"The EV maker also warned of ""notably lower"" sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.","Tesla expects to start production of its long-anticipated, next-generation electric vehicle at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday.
But Tesla shares were down 6.5% in premarket trading as Musk noted that ramping up production of the new vehicle would be challenging and Tesla also warned of sharp slowdown in sales growth this year before the new model launch. Musk said it would take ‚Äúa tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology‚Äù required ‚Äì a sign that any boost to Tesla‚Äôs declining pace of growth would take time.
His projection followed a Reuters story earlier in the day saying Tesla had told suppliers to prepare for a June 2025 startup of a smaller crossover vehicle, critical for the automaker as it loses share to inexpensive EVs such as those made by China‚Äôs BYD.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in the second half,‚Äù Musk told analysts on a post-earnings call.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be sleeping on the line practically,‚Äù he said, referring to Tesla‚Äôs factory in Texas, where the new model will be first produced. That will be followed by Mexico and another factory outside North America to be decided later this year, he said.
The EV maker also warned of ‚Äúnotably lower‚Äù sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.
Tesla said it was in between two growth waves: one driven by the release of Models 3 and Y in 2017 and 2020, respectively, and a second wave that would start with the next-generation vehicle platform.
ADVERTISEMENT
Wall Street expects Tesla to sell 2.2 million vehicles this year, according to Visible Alpha. That would be up about 21% from 2023 but well below the long-term target of 50% that Musk set about three years ago. Tesla, however, did not reiterate that target on Wednesday.
After years of breakneck growth, Tesla is bracing for slowing growth and margins as EV demand softens and competition intensifies.
‚ÄúIf volume‚Äôs going to be lower, then my guess is, Musk will probably cut prices and take share. Margins may continue to struggle for a while,‚Äù said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at shareholder Hodges Capital Management.
Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially in the fourth quarter, but Tesla cautioned it was approaching ‚Äúthe natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup,‚Äù underscoring the pressure on the company to launch its new lower-cost vehicles. BYD sold more EVs globally than Tesla in the fourth quarter.
ADVERTISEMENT
Musk said Chinese automakers will have significant success outside of China. ‚ÄúIf there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.‚Äù
Tesla reported a gross margin of 17.6% for the three months ended December, compared with 23.8% a year earlier, and analysts‚Äô average estimate of 18.3%, according to LSEG data.
Automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits ‚Äì a closely watched figure ‚Äì dropped to 17.2% from 24.3% a year earlier, although it improved from 16.3% in the third quarter.
‚ÄúToday‚Äôs flat sales and substantially reduced margin results are further evidence that Tesla is losing its leadership advantage and its brand leadership has weakened,‚Äù said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand.

MORE PRICE CUTS?
Tesla slashed prices of its cars since late 2022, igniting a price war that singed U.S. rivals including Ford, who have all slowed EV production.
Musk said on Wednesday that Tesla‚Äôs margins will depend on how fast interest rates fall.
Its stock, which has enjoyed valuations of a technology company partly due to Musk‚Äôs promise of self-driving cars, has fallen 16% so far this year, after doubling in 2023
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the price cuts are over, mainly for the reason that demand for its electric vehicles is still weak,‚Äù said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Net income more than doubled from the previous year to $7.9 billion, including a $5.9 billion noncash gain related to deferred tax assets. Tesla said lower raw material costs and U.S. government credits helped lower cost-per-vehicle, but Cybertruck production and AI and other research projects increased costs.
On an adjusted basis, Tesla earned 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter, missing an average analysts‚Äô estimate of 74 cents, according to LSEG data.
Tesla‚Äôs fourth-quarter revenue rose 3% to $25.17 billion, which marked its slowest pace of growth in more than three years. Analysts on average expected $25.62 billion, according to LSEG data.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/tesla-will-start-making-new-ev-model-in-second-half-of-2025-9126688/,technology

‚ÄúWhen I started playing cricket and then made my (Test) debut, I never thought about playing hundred Test matches. For me, it is always about being in the present and not thinking too far ahead. So, for me, I thought before this series started and that‚Äôs when I realised that I will be playing my hundredth Test match. In a career, you always go through ups and downs, and you have to fight through those periods,‚Äù Cheteshwar Pujara said in the pre-match press conference on Thursday.
India must win the second Test against Australia in Delhi, which begins on Friday, to maintain their lead in the Test rankings and come closer to qualifying for the World Test Championship final in June. To qualify for the final, India must win the series 3-1 or 3-0.

When Pujara takes to the field against Australia in the second Test at Delhi from February 17 onwards, he will become only the 13th player to reach the landmark of 100 Test matches for India. The most number of Test matches in cricket is played by legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, who is the only cricketer to have played 200 matches in the longer format.
‚ÄúThere is a lot more to achieve. I am definitely satisfied and really excited to play this hundredth Test match. But at the same time, we are playing an important series. So, hopefully, we win this Test match and move on to win another Test match which will ensure we will qualify for the WTC final. My dream is to win a WTC final for the Indian team, which didn‚Äôt happen in the last final. But hopefully, once we qualify, we move towards that,‚Äù he added.

Lewis Hamilton on FIA rule: ‚ÄòNothing will stop me from speaking‚Äô,"Hamilton said he will continue to use his global platform to promote his wide-ranging interests, which include social justice and race, human rights and protection of the LBGTQ community.","Seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton insisted he will not be silenced by offseason rules that prohibit drivers from speaking out on political issues.
Hamilton said Wednesday he will continue to use his global platform to promote his wide-ranging interests, which include social justice and race, human rights and protection of the LBGTQ community.
The FIA in December updated its International Sporting Code to require prior written permission for drivers to make or display ‚Äúpolitical, religious and personal statements or comments‚Äù during race weekends. The FIA is the governing body for Formula One.
Mercedes‚Äô Lewis Hamilton during a press conference. ( Reuters )
The crackdown on free speech has been condemned by most drivers but Hamilton only weighed in for the first time Wednesday, when Mercedes revealed its 2023 car.
Hamilton said the FIA crackdown ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt surprise me‚Äù but he quickly dismissed it when he learned about it over the offseason.
‚ÄúNothing will stop me from speaking on the things that I feel that I‚Äôm passionate about and issues there are,‚Äù Hamilton said. ‚ÄúI feel the sport does have a responsibility, still, always, to speak out as a means to create awareness on important topics, particularly as we are traveling to all these different places, so nothing changes.‚Äù
Asked if he was prepared to be penalized by the FIA for violating the new rule, Hamilton said ‚Äúit would be silly to say I would want to take extra penalty points‚Äù but remained steadfast in that he won‚Äôt be silenced.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúI‚Äôm still going to be speaking on my end,‚Äù Hamilton said. ‚ÄúWe still have this platform. There‚Äôs a lot of things we need to tackle.‚Äù
Most of the drivers have spoken out against the new rule and most recently by F1 boss Stefano Domenicali, who recently told The Guardian newspaper the series would not be imposing any sort of gag. Domenicali said he expected the FIA to soon clarify its position.
Hamilton is the most vocal driver in F1 and remains the same change agent 17 years into his career as when he became the first Black winner in F1 in 2008. The British racer is now 38 years old, the winningest driver in series history and is tied with Michael Schumacher with a record seven titles.
Hamilton remains the only Black driver at the most elite level of motorsports.
ADVERTISEMENT
Hamilton often speaks out while racing in countries with questionable human rights records, or when an issue arises in which he feels his voice can lend support, which would be banned under the new FIA rule.
Hamilton last year sparred with the FIA over its crackdown of drivers wearing jewelry in the car and mocked the rule by arriving at a news conference wearing three watches, eight rings and multiple necklaces. Hamilton and the FIA had a protracted back-and-forth over the jewelry ban in which he received an extension on a deadline to remove some piercings; the two sides eventually came to an agreement.

"Need to find ways to make operations sustainable, environment friendly: Maruti Suzuki India MD","With passenger vehicle industry set to touch 60-70 lakh units per annum, there is a need to review and re-align businesses to the much higher scale of operations, with an enhanced focus on sustainability, Maruti Suzuki India MD and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said on Wednesday.","With passenger vehicle industry set to touch 60-70 lakh units per annum, there is a need to review and re-align businesses to the much higher scale of operations, with an enhanced focus on sustainability, Maruti Suzuki India MD and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi said on Wednesday.
Speaking at the ACMA annual session here, Takeuchi also emphasised on making the operations environment friendly.
‚ÄúToday, India has become the third largest automobile market in the world. Going ahead, it is estimated that, by FY30-31, the annual passenger vehicle market size will expand to 6 to 7 million units,‚Äù Takeuchi said.
ADVERTISEMENT
This means the scale of operations will nearly double from the present levels, he added.
‚ÄúOur businesses will therefore need to be reviewed and re-aligned to the new and much higher scale of operations which will spread across multiple locations. At the same time, we need to find ways to make our operations sustainable and environmentally friendly,‚Äù Takeuchi noted.
He also urged the domestic component industry to work towards strengthening local design and development capability and also enhance skills of the existing manpower in order to diversify and grow business.
Takeuchi also emphasised on increasing competitiveness and having greater focus on capacity and capability in the automotive component sector.
ADVERTISEMENT
He noted that globally, there are developments around sustainability, and these are leading to adoption of new technologies and fuels thus presenting a big opportunity especially for the Indian auto component manufacturers.
‚ÄúSo far, you have been one of the epitomes for ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô. Now, having acquired the manufacturing prowess we have to move towards ‚ÄòDesign in India‚Äô,‚Äù Takeuchi said.
He also emphasised the importance of having skilled human resources to meet volume and technology aspirations.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúIndia has a huge talent pool but to make them industry ready there is a greater need to collaborate across the value chain. Here, I request active support from the government as well,‚Äù Takeuchi said.
It is also important to strengthen Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) capabilities to unlock greater value for business, he added.
‚ÄúStrengthening ESG capabilities will not only make us future ready and increase competitiveness but will prepare us for the upcoming regulatory compliances,‚Äù Takeuchi said.
He also asked the auto components industry to keep re-investing in their core businesses.
‚ÄúFor sustainable business operations and to benefit from the growing automobile market, re-investing in the core business and futuristic technologies is very important. We need to invest more in the automobile business,‚Äù he noted.
ADVERTISEMENT
With higher scale, new technologies, multiple locations, and external uncertainties the complexity of business is going up, he said.
‚ÄúTo ensure continuity in such a scenario it is very important that we keep strengthening our risk management capabilities,‚Äù he added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Along with these, as an industry there is a need to continue to have a high focus on quality and safety, Takeuchi said.
‚ÄúThese are of greater emphasis for making our business sustainable and competitive,‚Äù he added.
ADVERTISEMENT
Takeuchi also asked the auto components industry to support the PV makers in their pursuit of developing various alternative fuel technologies like CNG, Hybrid-electric, Electric and Hydrogen.
‚ÄúSince the Indian market is so diverse and wide, it is our responsibility to work on all these powertrain technologies to serve the environment. We also look forward to our component vendor partners to support us in all these powertrain technologies,‚Äù he said.
Earlier speaking at the event, ACMA President Sunjay Kapur said the industry needs to embrace the profound changes happening towards cleaner fuels.

Kaathal The Core movie review: Mammootty and Jyotika outdo themselves in Jeo Baby‚Äôs landmark film,"Kaathal ‚Äì The Core movie review: Jeo Baby's film, starring Mammootty and Jyotika, is a groundbreaking film that should be watched by all, particularly those in the film industry who continue to present recycled age-old narratives, expecting unquestioning acceptance from the audiences.","Ever wondered why many films addressing socially relevant themes struggle to connect with a broader audience? One key reason is their tendency to adopt a preachy approach, assuming the intellectual inferiority of the general public. Instead of allowing viewers to immerse themselves in a story and draw their own conclusions, these films tend to dictate the message.
Another issue lies in the setting. Often, when discussing topics such as sexual orientation and/or feminism, stories unfold in urban/elite environments with convenient narrative choices, wherein even initially problematic or elderly characters eventually shift to the right side expressing solidarity after the main characters deliver a ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô speech. This approach un/intentionally implies that only the rich, educated or upper caste/class are likely to understand such matters and be open to changing their perspectives. But what happens when these matters arise in common households, in the lives of ordinary people who constitute a larger portion of the population? How would/should a working-class family respond to a member coming out?

"Bradley Cooper‚Äôs Maestro: A tale of music, marriage and multitasking","Maestro is a biopic on Leonard Bernstein, a celebrated U.S. conductor and composer, who wrote classical music and iconic hit musicals like West Side Story.","Co-writing, directing, producing and starring in his Leonard Bernstein biopic Maestro was a terrifying undertaking for Bradley Cooper that turned into a journey of joy and courage.
A passion project years in the making, Maestro is the follow up to Cooper‚Äôs directorial debut, A Star Is Born.
‚ÄúIn the beginning, realising how much work would be involved, I was terrified. But the more work I put in, and then each day, I became more and more at ease with the idea of being able to ask everybody to go on this journey,‚Äù Cooper told Reuters at the film‚Äôs premiere in London last week.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúBy the end of it, it was just joy and fearlessness.‚Äù
Leonard Bernstein, who died in 1990, was a celebrated U.S. conductor and composer, who wrote classical music and iconic hit musicals like West Side Story.
Maestro focuses on his relationship with his wife, Felicia Montealegre, played by British actor Carey Mulligan, and on his bisexuality.
‚ÄúLenny and Felicia were filled with a lot of passion and we were so excited that we were able to put our energy into a story about people that really loved life and lived life in such a dynamic way,‚Äù said Cooper.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúAt the time there was so much mutual love for them as a couple, everyone referred to them as Lenny and Felicia. It feels so appropriate that the film is their story and their love story,‚Äù added Mulligan, who said being directed by her co-star was her ‚Äúfavourite experience ever‚Äù.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never experienced anything like it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt feel like two separate things. There‚Äôs no acting required, you just are in the scene, I think that‚Äôs a testament to a truly great director.‚Äù
The children of Bernstein and Montealegre were closely involved in the development of the movie. Maestro was made for their family, said Cooper, and everything else, including Oscar talk, is extra.
‚ÄúWe had a really profound relationship with them throughout this whole experience. It really is about serving their parents in this art form and all this other stuff is awesome and it‚Äôs fun, but it has nothing to do with why we did it.‚Äù
Maestro starts streaming on Netflix from December 20.

"Household debt doubles in FY23, savings more than halves to 5.15% of GDP","The net financial savings of households plunged by close to 55 per cent in FY23 to 5.1 per cent of GDP, and their indebtedness more than doubled to Rs 15.6 lakh crore from FY21, primarily led by massive borrowings from banks, shows an analysis of latest official numbers.","The net financial savings of households plunged by close to 55 per cent in FY23 to 5.1 per cent of GDP, and their indebtedness more than doubled to Rs 15.6 lakh crore from FY21, primarily led by massive borrowings from banks, shows an analysis of latest official numbers.
According to SBI Research, a good portion of the drawdown from savings have gone to physical assets and of the Rs 8.2 lakh crore increase in household indebtedness in FY23, as much as Rs 7.1 lakh crore accounted for bank borrowings, primarily for home loans and other retail finances.
In FY23, household savings plunged to 5.1 per cent of GDP, from 11.5 per cent in FY21, a 50-year low, and 7.6 per cent in FY20, which was not the pandemic period.
ADVERTISEMENT
It can be noted that the most important source of funds for the two deficit sectors ‚Äî general government finances and the non-financial corporations, are household savings.
The household sector in the national accounts includes, apart from individuals, all non-government, non-corporate enterprises like farm and non-farm businesses, unincorporated establishments like sole proprietorships and partnerships and non-profit institutions.
According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the group chief economic adviser at the State Bank of India, financial liabilities jumped by Rs 8.2 lakh crore since the pandemic, outpacing the increase in gross financial savings of Rs 6.7 lakh crore.
On the asset side of households, there was an increase of Rs 4.1 lakh crore in insurance and provident funds and pension funds during the period.
On the liability side of the households, of the Rs 8.2 lakh crore increase, as much as Rs 7.1 lakh crore accounted for an increase in household borrowings from commercial banks.
ADVERTISEMENT
When juxtaposed this increase in borrowings from banks with the increase in bank credit, as much as 55 per cent of the retail credit to households in the last two years have gone to housing, education and vehicle purchases.
According to Ghosh, this is possible due to the low interest rate regime, resulting in a paradigm shift of household financial savings to household physical savings in the last two years.
He sees a significant long-run relationship between housing loans and households‚Äô savings in physical assets. As a result, the decline in net financial savings of households has resulted in a concomitant increase in household savings in gross physical assets.
ADVERTISEMENT
In fact, savings in physical assets, which accounted for more than two-thirds of household savings in FY12, had declined to 48 per cent in FY21.
However, the trend is again shifting and the share of physical assets is expected to reach 70 per cent in FY23, due to a decline in share of financial assets.
Ghosh also believes that the shift to physical assets is also triggered by a recovery in the real estate sector and the increase in property prices.
Meanwhile, the household debt-to-GDP ratio has increased during the pandemic but has declined thereafter. The household debt as percentage of GDP was at 40.7 in March 2020, and has then fallen to 36.5 in June 2023.
Over the years, 80-90 per cent of household physical savings were in dwellings, other buildings and structures and rest in machinery and equipment.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/banking-and-finance/household-debt-doubles-fy23-savings-more-than-halves-gdp-8950080/,business

"IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 2: Rohit Sharma slams ton, Jadeja-Axar extend India‚Äôs lead to 144 runs","India vs Australia Day 2: India have a grip over this Test, thanks to the Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.","India vs Australia, 1st Test Day 2: Just as on Day 1, Ravindra Jadeja was the hero for the Indian team on Day 2 of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, after scoring 66 runs with the bat. He consolidated on Rohit Sharma‚Äôs 120-run effort to hand India a decisive advantage on Day 2 of the first Test at stumps. The hosts were leading by 144 runs at the end of day‚Äôs play. Axar Patel also joined in with a half century of his own, ending the day with a knock of 52 runs.
For Australia, 22-year-old spinner Todd Murphy was the star with the ball, claiming a five-wicket haul to end the day with figures of 82/5 in 36 overs.
Only time will tell how critical to the larger scheme of things that dropped catch of Jadeja in the final over of the day will prove to be. In fact, that opportunity came to Australia‚Äôs Steve Smith in the penultimate ball of the second day.
Jadeja, as his all-round effort testifies, has come out hungry to do well and make an impact on this series, particularly after spending a large amount of time last year out of the game, rehabilitating from a knee injury.
India vs Australia, 1st Test Day 2 Tea Update
Earlier, Rohit and Jadeja frustrated the Australians in the second session of Day 2 of, with the duo taking India past 200 at tea break. As Sharma scored his first century as a captain in Tests, Jadeja, who has a history of digging in his heels particularly when the Australians are starting to take control of the game, was at his opportunistic best, punishing the Australian bowlers whenever he saw a slip-up.
You can also follow our full highlights of the second day‚Äôs action from the first Test on our liveblog. 
Before start of play, Marnus Labuschagne had spoken of how one wicket can turn the complexion of the game by giving the example of how Australia slid from 84 for 2 to being all out for 177. While India did lose the wickets of Virat Kohli (12) and Suryakumar Yadav (eight) close to each other, Jadeja held down the door.
ADVERTISEMENT
Yadav, whose inclusion in the side for the first Test evoked quite a lot of debate, started his debut Test innings with flair: sweeping  the second ball he faced from Todd Murphy for a boundary to get off the mark! That was, however, the only boundary he scored, falling for just eight runs off 20 deliveries. Murphy has been the pick of the Australian innings so far, claiming four wickets for 59 runs. Nathan Lyon has just the one wicket so far, but he cleaned up Yadav with an absolute peach of a delivery.
India vs Australia, 1st Test Day 2 lunch update
Leading from the front, Rohit Sharma helped India assert their dominance by lunch break of Day 2. The Indian skipper had scored 85 runs at the end of the first session of Friday at Nagpur. Giving him company at the other end was Virat Kohli, who was batting at 12. India were 151/3. Australia took two wickets in that session, India scored 74 runs to come within 26 runs of overhauling Australia‚Äôs first session total.
When the day started, Ravichandran Ashwin got into the act as well, showing why he is a man with five centuries and 13 half centuries. But he lost his wicket for 23 runs with youngster Todd Murphy claiming his wicket too after taking KL Rahul‚Äôs scalp on Day 1. The, before India‚Äôs best player of spin, Cheteshwar Pujara could really get settled at the crease, he induced a top edge while the batter tried to sweep. Pujara was gone for seven runs, with his stint in the middle lasting just 14 balls.
Murphy was the pick of the bowlers in the first session as well.

At the other end, Sharma‚Äôs wicket was barely threatened during the first session, except when there was a mix-up with Kohli in the 48th over with him batting on 83. But the throw at the non-striker‚Äôs end was not on target so Sharma survived a close call.
Australia‚Äôs woes were compounded by the fact that Matt Renshaw had to been sent for scans after injuring his knee during the warm-up for Day 2.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-1st-test-day-2-lunch-update-rohit-sharma-on-cusp-of-century-todd-murphy-makes-mark-8435998/,sports

IND vs ENG: How India‚Äôs batsmen capitalised on England‚Äôs callow bowling group,"With just one seamer, a spin pair with an experience of one game, Jaiswal made merry of England‚Äôs inexperience.","At the end of Day One, of a series that promises plenty of thrills and twists, Yashasvi Jaiswal, with an unbeaten 76 off 70 deliveries, has opened up a glaring hole in England‚Äôs set-up that has the potential to bury them down. Their inexperience.
Two of their three spinners with a combined experience of just one Test before this are not showing sufficient signs of complimenting Jack Leach, whose control alone may not be enough for them to get the job done, particularly on a pitch that is on the slower side. How much their decision to go without a second seamer could cost them only time will tell, but India have, so far, made full use of it.
Having restricted England to 246 on what is probably the most batting friendly surface in recent times (barring the one in Ahmedabad against Australia, which played out a draw), India‚Äôs response seems to suggest they want to bat just once and big. With 119/1 on board, and still trailing by 127 runs, a big first innings lead, which England cannot swat away quickly, will be India‚Äôs primary target on Day 2. If not, there is enough time in the Test for scripting comebacks. While the pitch at Hyderabad was not as hostile as it was in Nagpur, Delhi or Indore last year, in the Australia series, it is expected to undergo wear and tear as the game progresses. Batting last in India, as you would know, comes with its own risk.
READ | India vs England 1st Test: How Bazball played out amidst the craft and cunning of India‚Äôs spin trio
Axar Patel, who grabbed two wickets, including a ripper to dismiss Jonny Bairstow, summed up the pitch and outlined India‚Äôs plans. ‚ÄúThey made 246 and we know that the wicket was good. There is spin but the wicket is slow and we know that we did well to restrict them to 246,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will look to bat long and then runs will be taken care of. I don‚Äôt think the pitch is having any excessive spin, it‚Äôs just normal spin. As I said the pitch is slow and we can adjust to it as the ball is getting slow after pitching. It is a bit challenging as well for the batters but if you bat well then you can make runs here. It is challenging for bowlers as well because the outfield is quick here and you can go for runs if you err in line and length even slightly,‚Äù he added.
Purpose and intent
India‚Äôs response has been commendable so far. In the 23 overs they batted, they were all purpose and showed the intent that was needed to make full use of the good work their bowlers put in. With Wood being the lone seamer ‚Äì Ben Stokes won‚Äôt be bowling because he has just recovered from a leg injury ‚Äì he had to be on the dot and there was no room for error. But a gifted length delivery first up allowed Jaiswal to start with a boundary before he welcomed Tom Hartley to Test cricket with a six wide of long-on.

Four balls later, he swept him over the ropes. On such pitches, spells with the new ball tend to make a difference, but Wood ‚Äì taking the new ball for the first time since 2015 ‚Äì continued to be wayward, sending an eight-ball over in his second that hardly troubled Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma. As Hartley conceded 13 more of his second over, Ben Stokes would ultimately turn to Leach to find some control as early as the fifth over.
It was a fascinating approach from India, who despite wanting to bat long and big, were in the mood to take on the attack. This wasn‚Äôt mindless slogging, but a calculative approach, where they targeted the inexperienced spinners, not letting them settle down on a line and length, using the feet when needed to put pressure. The only mistake that India made with the bat was when Rohi tried to dish out the same punishing treatment to Leach, but managed only to mistime it as far as Stokes at mid-on. It led to a few nervy moments with Shubman Gill surviving a close LBW call, as even Jaiswal took pedal off a bit to limit any further damage.

Having put early pressure on Hartley and Rehan Ahmed, whose wrist-spin went for 22 runs in three overs, unless England pick early wickets on Day 2, they could well be in for a long day. For this doesn‚Äôt look like one of those surfaces where wickets will fall in a cluster. This is a pitch where the bowlers need to have impeccable control and attack the stumps more. So far, England have seldom done that, giving India the gifts they would have hoped for. Unless England‚Äôs inexperienced attack manages to hit the right notes on Friday morning, India‚Äôs plan to bat once and for big will materialize, provided they apply themselves. Having adopted a naturally aggressive approach as their head coach Rahul Dravid had mentioned in the pre-game presser, how they go about their business on Day 2 will set the tone for the Test.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-1st-test-india-batsmen-yashasvi-jaiswal-rohit-sharma-shubman-gill-9127865/,sports

Under a thousand: Adding a real macro lens to your phone camera,Skyvik Signi X Mobile Camera 20X macro lens kit adds a real macro lens to your phone for not too much money.,"Mention macro cameras on smartphones, especially mid-segment ones, and we are sure that most people will simply shake their heads in disappointment. And with good reason. While many phones in the Rs 10,000 ‚Äì Rs 45,000 price segment claim to come with dedicated macro sensors, these are often very token 2 or 5 megapixel affairs that boost spec sheets and sink photography. Macro or super close up photography for many of the users of such phones means taking a high resolution snap from the main camera and then cropping it to get a closer look at a subject.
The Signi X is very solidly built with a good quality plastic clip with the lens on one side (Express Photo)
An affordable macro lens with premium feels and accessories
The rather elaborately named Skyvik Signi X Mobile Camera 20X macro lens kit changes that. As its name indicates, it is a macro lens that adds 20x magnification to any phone camera. There have been such lenses in the past but they have tended to be difficult to use, compatible only with some phones and often very expensive (low priced options generally comes low image and product quality). The Signi X fortunately is a rather different kettle of macro fish.

Saudi football influence grows by winning seat on FIFA Council,The election win at the Asian Football Confederation‚Äôs annual meeting followed Cristiano Ronaldo arrival last month to play in the Saudi league and longstanding speculation about a likely bid to host the World Cup in 2030 or 2034.,"Saudi Arabia added to its influence in world soccer on Wednesday, winning a seat on the FIFA Council and then being confirmed as host of the 2027 Asian Cup.
The election win at the Asian Football Confederation‚Äôs annual meeting followed Cristiano Ronaldo arrival last month to play in the Saudi league and longstanding speculation about a likely bid to host the World Cup in 2030 or 2034.
Saudi soccer federation president Yasser Almisehal was among six Asian soccer officials elected by AFC members to represent them on FIFA‚Äôs decision-making committee through 2027. Saudi Arabia was the only candidate to host the Asian championship.
Qatari soccer federation president Sheikh Hamad Al Thani, whose country hosts the next Asian Cup in January 2024, also was elected to the FIFA Council. Sheikh Hamad earned 40 votes from the 45 federations, while Almisehal got 35.
The 37-member FIFA Council is chaired by Gianni Infantino, the governing body‚Äôs president who attended the election meeting in Bahrain.
The election results confirmed Saudi Arabia and Qatar at the heart of Asian soccer politics with the AFC presidency scheduled to be vacant in 2027.
AFC president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain was reelected by acclamation Wednesday to a final four-year term in a job he has held since 2013. He is also formally No. 2 to Infantino as the most senior of FIFA‚Äôs eight vice presidents.

FIFA Council positions ‚Äî which pay a $250,000 salary in Zurich ‚Äî were also won by Kohzo Tashima of Japan and Mariano Araneta of the Philippines, who retained their seats, and newcomer Hamidin Bin Mohd Amin, the Malaysian soccer federation leader.
Losing candidates were Du Zhaocai of China and Chung Mong-Gyu of South Korea, a scion of the family that owns Hyundai and who lost his seat in 2019.
The election for a FIFA Council seat protected for a woman was won by Kanya Keomany of Laos.
Later in the meeting, the Saudi bid to host the 2027 Asian Cup was confirmed unopposed. India withdrew its bid in December.
ADVERTISEMENT
Presenting the bid on stage, Saudi sports minister Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal called the 2027 tournament ‚Äúa transformational moment in our collective football story.‚Äù
Saudi Arabia is a three-time champion of the Asian Cup, in 1984, 1988 and 1996, but has never hosted the tournament.
The kingdom raised its soccer profile when Ronaldo signed a 2 1/2-year deal with Al Nassr, and has been speculatively linked with a three-continent co-hosting bid to host the 2030 World Cup with Egypt from Africa and Greece from Europe.
That would require sending the tournament back to Asia and the Arabian Gulf only eight years after Qatar hosted the 2022 edition. A 2034 bid could be more realistic.

FIFA is expected to let more than 200 member federations choose the 2030 host next year.
Spain and Portugal, currently with Ukraine also, are planning a European bid for the 2030 World Cup, while a four-nation South American bid that brings together Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay, the inaugural host 100 years earlier in 1930, is also expected.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/saudi-football-influence-grows-by-winning-seat-on-fifa-council-8418461/,sports

"From OnePlus 7 Pro to Xperia Z5 Premium, 5 discontinued flagships that are still worth buying in 2023","You won‚Äôt believe how good these 5 old phones look and perform in 2023. They‚Äôre discontinued, but not forgotten.","Phones these days are getting pretty much identical, with most brands chasing the same trends and features to the point that things have gotten a bit‚Ä¶boring? So if you find yourself longing for the golden age of smartphone innovation from just a few years ago, you‚Äôre not alone. Here are 5 now-discontinued smartphones from the late 2010s that are still worth it.
OnePlus 7 Pro
(Image: OnePlus)
Launched back in 2019, the OnePlus 7 Pro is anything but outdated even in 2023. There are few phones today that look as futuristic as this one ‚Äì the bezels are as slim as can be for when the phone launched and there‚Äôs no notch or even a punch hole to mess up the immersive full-screen viewing experience.
The front camera is cleverly tucked away in a pop-up module so it doesn‚Äôt get in the way of that gorgeous display. And yet even with such hardware, the Snapdragon 855-powered 7 Pro is still lighter than most new 2023 flagships at just 205 grams. You can‚Äôt buy the OnePlus 7 Pro new anymore since it‚Äôs discontinued, but you can still find refurbished models on reseller sites like Cashify for less than Rs 20k which is a steal.

Redmi K20 Pro

Dropping mere days after the OnePlus 7 Pro in 2019 was the legendary Redmi K20 Pro, another phone its loyal owners still swear by. This thing has stood the test of time remarkably well and the pop-up camera is even cooler than the 7 Pro‚Äôs ‚Äì it lights up. Beyond the flashy front camera, the versatile triple camera system with 48MP primary, 8MP 2x telephoto and 13MP ultrawide lenses at the back still holds up.
2019 was truly an excellent vintage for flagship Android phones and if you want to revisit those glory days, you can buy the K20 Pro used online or visit your local offline phone shop. Considering how popular this model was, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll have one in stock.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10
(Image: Samsung)
Yet another classic 2019 release was the Galaxy Note 10, the first Note to ditch the bezels for a gorgeous full-screen design. Samsung nailed it with this one ‚Äì with a 91% screen-to-body ratio, the Note 10 still looks like it could‚Äôve rolled off the production line for a 2023 Galaxy Unpack launch. Moreover, despite being a Note with its signature stylus, the screen is only 6.3 inches, making it surprisingly compact and pocketable for a phone you can scribble on.
Apple iPhone X
(Image: Apple)
Going back a bit further to 2017, the revolutionary iPhone X was truly ahead of its time ‚Äì Apple called it the ‚Äúfuture of the smartphone‚Äù and they weren‚Äôt kidding considering how nearly every brand copied its futuristic bezel-less notched design soon after. The X was so far ahead that 6 years later, the latest iPhones still take after its iconic look.

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium

Lastly, the Sony Xperia Z5 Premium might not have had the best performance or heat management (thanks to the infamous Snapdragon 810), but it was arguably Sony‚Äôs last hoorah before its downfall. And the chrome colour version alone was to die for ‚Äì an absolute fingerprint magnet but nothing screamed ‚Äúpremium‚Äù quite like its reflective shine.
Beyond the flashy exterior, the Z5 Premium stood out with its bonkers 2160 x 3840 4K display rocking a pixel density of 806 ppi. This thing never sold well, but if you‚Äôre a Sony fan and come across one used online, it‚Äôs the ultimate relic to relive their glory days.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/5-discontinued-flagships-worth-buying-in-2023-9013357/,technology

"Gold stays near 1-month lows as US dollar, yields hold ground","Gold prices held near one-month lows on Friday, shrugging off cooler-than-expected US inflation figures for last month, with bullion staying on course to wrap up its worst week in seven.","Gold prices held near one-month lows on Friday, shrugging off cooler-than-expected U.S. inflation figures for last month, with bullion staying on course to wrap up its worst week in seven as the U.S. dollar and bond yields stood strong.
Spot gold edged 0.1% higher to $1,913.95 per ounce by 0347 GMT, but traded near its lowest level since July 7 touched earlier in the day. U.S. gold futures were down 0.1% at $1,946.20.
Gold gained as much as 0.8% on Thursday after data showed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) climbed 3.2% on an annual basis, but was less than the Reuters poll forecast of 3.3%, raising bets that the U.S. central bank will unlikely hike interest rates again in 2023.

Interest rate increases weigh on gold because they tend to lift bond yields and in turn raise the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
‚ÄúOnce the CPI dust had settled, markets seemed to remember that core CPI at 4.7% is still not great ‚Äì even if it was slower than expected,‚Äù said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at City Index, adding that gold‚Äôs move higher lacked conviction.
‚ÄúWe also had Fed member Mary Daly putting a fly in the dovish ointment, saying whether another hold or hike at the Fed‚Äôs next meeting is ‚Äòyet to be determined‚Äô. And that saw the U.S. dollar regain its strength.‚Äù
Gold prices have slid about 1.4% so far in the week as the U.S. dollar index and benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields were both on track for their fourth consecutive weekly gain.

European firms urge China to give more clarity on data transfer laws,"The world's second-largest economy has in recent years tightened its data laws amid President Xi Jinping's increased focus on national security, and foreign firms fear their lack of clarity could trip them up.","European firms ‚Äúurgently‚Äù need China to give clearer definitions of key terms in its cross-border data transfer rules, a European business lobby group said on Wednesday, warning that firms also stood to waste millions of euros storing non-sensitive data in China.
The European Chamber of Commerce in China called on authorities to ‚Äúprovide precise definitions for both ‚Äúimportant data‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù, as outlined in their rules, and also urged that a proposed relaxation of certain aspects of regulations announced in September be finalised as soon as possible.

Jitters among foreign investors in China have risen over the past year due to a series of corporate raids, predominantly on consultancies and due diligence firms.
The chamber‚Äôs report echoes recent comments from a European Commission official, who said in September that European businesses were especially concerned about a lack of clarity in China‚Äôs data laws.
China in the same month also said it was considering waiving data export security assessments for activities such as international trade, academic cooperation, cross-border manufacturing and marketing that do not contain personal information or important data, a move that was welcomed by foreign business chambers and lawyers.

The Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with India, it said. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs economy showed robust growth over the past year. Headline inflation has, on average, moderated although it remains volatile,‚Äù the IMF said. Employment has surpassed the pre-pandemic level and, while the informal sector continues to dominate, formalisation has progressed. The financial sector has been resilient‚Äîstrongest in several years‚Äîand largely unaffected by global financial stress in early 2023, IMF said.
The current account deficit in the FY2022-23 (FY23) widened as the post-pandemic recovery of domestic demand and transitory external shocks outweighed the impact of robust services exports and proactive diversification of critical oil imports. While the budget deficit has eased, public debt remains elevated and fiscal buffers need to be rebuilt. Globally, India‚Äôs 2023 G20 presidency has demonstrated the country‚Äôs important role in advancing multilateral policy priorities.
‚ÄúWhile acknowledging declining systemic financial risks, directors broadly called for continued supervision and the use of prudential tools to preserve financial stability and manage emerging vulnerabilities, including rapid growth in unsecured personal loans. They advised further strengthening of regulatory and supervisory standards and encouraged public banks to continue building capital buffers,‚Äù the IMF added. The IMF said growth is expected to remain strong, supported by macroeconomic and financial stability. Real GDP is projected to grow at 6.3 per cent in FY24 and FY25, IMF said.

However, with better-than-expected second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) print at 7.6 per cent, the RBI, earlier this month, revised its growth estimate upwards to 7 per cent from 6.5 per cent for FY24.
The IMF said its headline inflation is expected to gradually decline to the target although it remains volatile due to food price shocks. The current account deficit is expected to improve to 1.8 per cent of GDP in FY24 as a result of resilient services exports and, to a lesser extent, lower oil import costs, the IMF said.
‚ÄúDirectors commended the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs proactive monetary policy actions and strong commitment to price stability. They agreed that the current neutral monetary policy stance, anchored on a data dependent approach, is appropriate and should gradually bring inflation back to target,‚Äù it said.

The seasoned Deepti (3/15) picked three wickets to become the first Indian to get to 100 T20I wickets.
Asked to bowl, Pooja Vastrakar (1/21), opening with the new ball, gave India the early breakthrough, getting rid of the dangerous Hayley Matthew (2), striking on her very first ball.
The West Indies skipper was done in by the extra bounce as Richa Ghosh completed a regulation catch.
Pooja continued to put pressure on the West Indies, bowling a wicket maiden. Shemaine Campbelle (30) hit West Indies‚Äô first boundary in the third over, slapping a Renuka Singh (1/22) delivery past square leg.
The introduction of spin led to West Indies collecting 12 runs, including two fours from Rajeshwari Gayakwad‚Äôs over.
West Indies were 53 for 1 at the halfway mark. Campbelle and Stefanie Taylor (42) steadied the West Indies innings as they slowly but steadily stitched a 73-run partnership. The two shared nine boundaries between them.

Chinelle Henry (2) was the next to go as Mandhana and Ghosh effected her run out.
India were able to stem the flow of runs but their fielding was found wanting. Deepti dropped Chedean Nation on 3 in the 16th over.

"OpenAI outlines AI safety plan, allowing board to reverse decisions",Microsoft-backed OpenAI will only deploy its latest technology if it is deemed safe in specific areas such as cybersecurity and nuclear threats.,"Artificial intelligence company OpenAI laid out a framework to address safety in its most advanced models, including allowing the board to reverse safety decisions, according to a plan published on its website Monday.
Microsoft-backed OpenAI will only deploy its latest technology if it is deemed safe in specific areas such as cybersecurity and nuclear threats. The company is also creating an advisory group to review safety reports and send them to the company‚Äôs executives and board. While executives will make decisions, the board can reverse those decisions.
Since ChatGPT‚Äôs launch a year ago, the potential dangers of AI have been top of mind for both AI researchers and the general public. Generative AI technology has dazzled users with its ability to write poetry and essays, but also sparked safety concerns with its potential to spread disinformation and manipulate humans.
In April, a group of AI industry leaders and experts signed an open letter calling for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4, citing potential risks to society. A May Reuters/Ipsos poll found that more than two-thirds of Americans are concerned about the possible negative effects of AI and 61% believe it could threaten civilization.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-outlines-ai-safety-plan-allowing-board-to-reverse-decisions-9073874/,technology

Ambani also underlined the commitment to fast-track execution of its Green Energy Giga Manufacturing Complex at Jamnagar. He also said that the company will deliver a fully-integrated, end-to-end solar PV manufacturing ecosystem.
Ambani said that RIL‚Äôs growth in the next 10 years will outstrip the growth it has seen in the past. ‚ÄúI am supremely confident that the value that your company will create for all its stakeholders over the next decade will be multiple times greater than what it has generated over the past 45 years,‚Äù he said.

He said said that Reliance has deliberately chosen to be in businesses that have large pent-up demand, which is guaranteed to grow at a healthy rate annually over many decades.
‚ÄúThis choice has led us to build businesses of global size and scale.

"Santner currently best spinner in white-ball cricket, lucky to have him: Mitchell",Santner returned with miserly figures of 2/11 from his four overs to set up New Zealand's 21-run win over India in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.,"New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell believes stand-in T20 captain Mitchell Santner is currently one of the best spinners in white-ball cricket after the left-arm tweaker‚Äôs impressive outing against India in the series opener here.
Santner returned with miserly figures of 2/11 from his four overs to set up New Zealand‚Äôs 21-run win over India in the first T20I of the three-match series on Friday.
Santner bowled a splendid spell and kept India under check by bowling a maiden over to Suryakumar Yadav in powerplay.
‚ÄúHe is one of the best spinners in world cricket with the white ball at the moment,‚Äù Mitchell, who was adjudged man-of-the-match for his 30-ball unbeaten 50, said at the post-match media interaction.
He picked up the wicket of in-form Shubman Gill, who inspired India to a 3-0 sweep over the Kiwis in the preceding ODI series.
‚ÄúHe (Santner) keeps proving his class. It was a very special spell by him that put us in a good position to win. He has done it for a long time now, we are very lucky to have him,‚Äù Mitchell said.
Put in, New Zealand got off to a fine start with opener Devon Conway smashing 52 off 35 balls, while Finn Allen made a quickfire 35 off 23 balls as the visitors set India a challenging target of 177.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúI thought the partnerships that Finn and Dev (Conway) did early and obviously Glenn (Phillips) and Dev as well allowed us to take the innings deeper and allowed us to put some pressure on India towards the end of the innings,‚Äù Mitchell said.
‚ÄúIt was about constantly adapting, trying to find ways to put pressure back on their bowlers.‚Äù On the spin-friendly Ranchi track, New Zealand spinners ‚Äî Santner, Ish Sodhi (1/30) and Michael Bracewell (2/31) ‚Äî picked up five wickets for 72 runs from 11 overs to derail India‚Äôs chase.
‚ÄúIt was definitely challenging at times through the middle, especially with the spinners,‚Äù Mitchell said.

IND vs ENG: India enter Bazball Universe with concerns about efficacy of turning tracks,"As the Bazball lands in India, with the first Test set to begin on Thursday in Hyderabad, all things point out to why the series could be the most challenging one for India.","It has been nearly 12 years since India lost a Test series at home. Since Alastair Cook‚Äôs England rallied to defeat them 2-1 in a four-match series, India have won 16 on the bounce ‚Äì a feat that not even the all-conquering West Indies and Australia sides of the past ‚Äì could come close. For 12 years, with a core of their XI remaining intact, they have looked truly invincible, having lost only three Tests at home. Beginning with Michael Clarke in 2013 to Pat Cummins in 2023, 14 captains have made attempts to win a series here. And among them only Steve Smith, Joe Root and Cummins have at least managed to win a Test here.
As the Bazball lands in India, with the first Test set to begin on Thursday in Hyderabad, all things point out to why the series could be the most challenging one for India. Like in 2012, when Andy Flower and Cook masterminded a sensational series win, defeating the hosts in their own game, India are a team in transition. And for the first two Tests in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, they will also be without Virat Kohli, meaning they will have the combined experience of their No 3, 4, 5, 6 will be only 86 Tests. And making it the most complicated for them is the Bazball approach from England, which is making them ponder over a lot.
While India have mostly preferred to play on turners since the World Test Championship came into picture, ahead of the England series there is an element of doubt if they stick to the same formula. Under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, England have binned all conventions associated with Test cricket. The concept of following something just because it has been the norm before doesn‚Äôt exist in the Bazball universe.
Despite breaking barriers, there are already questions flying from all directions in the Old Blighty if England are stretching it too far. For a series of this significance, they landed in India only on Sunday night and have just three training sessions before they take the field in Hyderabad. In Bazball universe, all the preparations for a gruelling India tour happened at Abu Dhabi from mid-January.
There is a rationale, not just bravado behind it. They feared that India might serve batting tracks with a second-string attack against them in practice games. And even if there was a turning track, it‚Äôs said that they feared the scenario where batsmen get out cheaply without facing many balls and are mopping around on the field without much practice. Instead, in Abu Dhabi, they have gone about training on custom-made tracks, working on a batting routine they hope to adopt in the Tests.
Plenty of questions for India
In the 24 matches since McCullum took over and has redefined how England play Test cricket, they have an overall strike-rate of 75.48 with the bat. In the same period, India‚Äôs is 54.57 and Australia 54.14.
This approach, where England‚Äôs batting unit never takes the pedal off, has put opposition bowlers off guard. The noise and buzz around it only adds to their aura. From having just one win out of 17 before McCullum and Stokes took charge, they have now won 13 in the next 18, including three in Pakistan and one in New Zealand. So this isn‚Äôt confined to home. Of course, the upcoming five in India will be a stern test, especially in conditions where the Bazball is yet to be tested.
ADVERTISEMENT
And it is this unknown element that is making India fret a bit. They are blinded as to what to expect and are huddled in conversations. All things point to India playing on a turner in Hyderabad, but it is understood that this could well turn into a series where the hosts will take stock match after match. While India will heavily rely on the spin trio of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, unlike the past there are deliberations if playing on turners could close the gap between the two sides, especially given India‚Äôs brittle middle-order.
On turning pitches, apart from toss becoming a crucial factor, it is one quick-fire innings from a batsman that has proved to be a big difference. It is the approach that even India‚Äôs batsmen are known to take on such conditions before they rely on the trio of spinners to do their job with the bat. However, with this high-risk game being England‚Äôs bread and butter, with their No 1 to No 11 following it to the T, there is more reason to be fearful of this approach as the game could unravel far more quickly than India have experienced at home.

With all the venues having black soil pitches, for now India believe the lack of bounce and pace off the pitch could keep England‚Äôs batting in check. Such tracks where the batting unit have to force the pace could also unsettle England‚Äôs plans of playing taller batsmen ‚Äì long reach against spinners ‚Äì to an extent.
There were even deliberations whether India should go back to their traditional flat decks, which they used to great success during the 2016/17 season where they defeated New Zealand, England and Australia. But even that comes with its own risk element, especially with Bazball. Apart from toss being a factor as batting last on a deteriorating surface could be quite risky, the Bazball has thrived especially in such conditions. Even back home in England, they have moved on from playing on green tracks, instead opting for flat decks that suit England‚Äôs stroke-makers.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really relate to the term Bazball,‚Äù Jasprit Bumrah would tell Guardian. ‚ÄúBut they are playing successful cricket and the aggressive route of taking the opposition on, showing the world there‚Äôs another way to play Test cricket. As a bowler, what I think is that it keeps me in play. And if they‚Äôre going for it, playing so fast, they won‚Äôt tire me out, I could get heaps [of wickets]. I always think about how I can use things to my advantage. Kudos to them but, as a bowler, you‚Äôre in the game.‚Äù Well, that‚Äôs one way to look at it, but there are concerns for India.
That they are facing their biggest ever test in over a decade without their best batsman makes it all the more interesting. Of course, given the calibre of India‚Äôs spinners which also includes Kuldeep Yadav, there is still every reason to believe they can extend their unbeaten streak at home. That Australia managed to keep the Bazball in check until Nathan Lyon was around at the Ashes last year would make India all the more hopeful, provided their batting unit steps up without their best Test batsman.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-india-enter-bazball-universe-with-concerns-about-efficacy-of-turning-tracks-9122553/,sports

UK‚Äôs handling of Microsoft deal sows doubts over post-Brexit direction,EU antitrust regulators said in response they would now look at whether the new terms would affect the concessions they had already agreed with the U.S. company.,"The long-running battle between Microsoft and Britain over the Activision Blizzard deal took another twist on Tuesday, raising more questions than answers about the country‚Äôs approach to deals in the post-Brexit era.
Britain‚Äôs Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been locked in a dispute with the U.S. software giant over its $69 billion bid to buy the ‚ÄúCall of Duty‚Äù maker since it opposed the takeover in April.
It had said in July, just minutes after the U.S. regulator failed in its own effort to stop the takeover in court, that it was willing to look again at the case when Microsoft returned with a ‚Äúdetailed and complex‚Äù proposal.
ADVERTISEMENT
On Tuesday it said it would stick to its original decision to block it.

But it will look at a separate restructured deal put forward by Microsoft, in which Activision would divest its cloud streaming rights to a third party ‚Äì France‚Äôs Ubisoft Entertainment ‚Äì excluding in the European Union.
The carve-out is designed to not upset a deal with Brussels for Microsoft to license content to rival cloud services.
EU antitrust regulators said in response they would now look at whether the new terms would affect the concessions they had already agreed with the U.S. company.
ADVERTISEMENT
Ronan Scanlan, a competition lawyer at Arthur Cox in Dublin, who previously worked for the CMA, said no one was well-served by the ‚Äúuncertainty and confusion‚Äù in Britain.
‚ÄúSome may say that the CMA has bent over backwards to accommodate Microsoft, others that this is the consequence of the CMA having over-reached in the first place,‚Äù he told Reuters.

TOUGH STANCE
The CMA had objected to the world‚Äôs biggest gaming deal over concerns it would hinder competition in the nascent cloud gaming sector, and said that a Microsoft offer to make Activision‚Äôs games available on rival leading cloud gaming platforms was not enough to remedy its concerns.
The decision underscored the tough new stance the CMA was taking against big technology after it became a standalone regulator following Britain‚Äôs departure from the European Union.
ADVERTISEMENT
Gustaf Duhs, a former CMA lawyer and competition lead at Stevens & Bolton, said the new proposal had moved beyond behavioural remedies, which the CMA had never liked, to something closer to a structural remedy.
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not a clean structural remedy because there‚Äôs still fundamentally a link between the activities of Microsoft and Ubisoft, and it‚Äôs limited rights that are being transferred,‚Äù he said.
The CMA could seek assurances on how Ubisoft would be able to use the rights, which would take the concession back into behavioural remedy territory, he added.
Scanlan said under the newly proposed deal the merged Microsoft-Activision would offer the gaming content to only one player, which will be allowed to commercialise the rights to other cloud gaming service providers.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said the question must be asked if the time it has taken to get to this point has been well-spent for all parties involved. ‚ÄúFew, other than perhaps the CMA, would answer in the affirmative,‚Äù he said.
Antony O‚ÄôLoughlin, head of litigation at law firm Setfords, agreed. ‚ÄúFor Microsoft and other regulators, this likely represents an unnecessary step the company‚Äôs been forced to take by an overzealous UK regulator, which still hasn‚Äôt green-lighted the deal,‚Äù he said.
The fate of Microsoft‚Äôs deal in Britain has brought in to question whether the CMA has the power to kill a megadeal if it is not in tune with the United States, European Union and China.
The CMA‚Äôs block in April drew fury from the merging parties, with Microsoft saying that Britain was closed for business.
ADVERTISEMENT
It said on Tuesday that it had not felt any political pressure over its handling of the deal.

Tom Smith, a partner at law firm Geradin Partners and previously legal director at the CMA, said both sides would portray the outcome as a win, with the CMA securing concessions that no other agency had achieved.
The CMA will also avoid having to defend its original block in court, and Microsoft finally looks set to secure its deal.
‚ÄúThe process has been tortuous, and there‚Äôs still possibly scope for the wheels to come off, but we shouldn‚Äôt expect Big Tech deals to sail through nowadays,‚Äù Smith said.

The CMA will now review the new proposal, with a deadline for an announcement by Oct. 18. It could order a much longer inquiry if it finds it still has competition concerns.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/uks-handling-of-microsoft-deal-sows-doubts-over-post-brexit-direction-8906101/,technology
"With several local languages, Nagaland urges Centre to allow teaching in English under NEP 2020","As per NEP 2020, the medium of instruction should be the mother tongue or local language until class 5, but preferably till class 8 and beyond.","The Nagaland government has urged the Centre to allow it to continue the use of English as the medium of teaching in schools instead of mother tongue as mandated by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 as the state has several tribal languages.
The implementation of NEP 2020 in the state is challenging as the state has over 20 different languages, said Kekhrielhoulie Yhome, the advisor for school education.
Nagaland has 17 recognised major Naga tribes speaking their own languages with no officially declared common dialect. English is the official language of the state, however, Nagamese ‚Äî a lingua franca which is a mixture of different dialects ‚Äî is used for daily conversations.
For a multi-diverse state like Nagaland, the implementation of NEP 2020 becomes difficult in the linguistic area, especially in the developing and urban areas, Yhome said, adding that mother tongue as a medium of instruction can be used in the rural areas and villages.
‚ÄúWe have 20-plus linguistic categories here while it is much more in the interior areas,‚Äù he said.
As per NEP 2020, the medium of instruction until class 5, but preferably till class 8 and beyond, is to be the mother tongue or local language.
Yhome said that faced with the challenge, the Department of School Education has requested the Ministry of Education to be ‚Äúmore flexible with Nagaland‚Äù on the medium of instruction.

‚ÄúWe have no option but to teach in English, especially in the urban areas,‚Äù he said while expressing optimism that the request would be considered by the Centre.
Yhome was speaking during the inaugural function of a four-day regional workshop on ‚Äòa study of school assessments and examination practices and equivalence of boards‚Äô, organised by PARAKH in collaboration with the Nagaland Board of School Education (NBSE).

Partey missed Arsenal‚Äôs 3-1 home defeat by Manchester City and 4-2 comeback victory at Aston Villa last week due to a lower back injury, while Jesus has been out of action since suffering a knee problem playing for Brazil at the World Cup in Qatar.
‚ÄúThomas has not trained much but looks like he could be available. Let‚Äôs see how he trains today,‚Äù Arteta told reporters on Friday on the eve of the visit to 14th-placed Leicester.
‚ÄúHe is a really important player for us who we missed in the last few games but hopefully he can be available.
‚Äú(Jesus) is progressing well. He is doing more and more on the field. The knee is not reacting so it‚Äôs really positive. We want him back quickly but respect the timeline from the doctors. He is usually pushing the boundaries.‚Äù
Arsenal lead the table with 54 points, two above second-placed City who have played a game more. Manchester United sit third with 49, while Tottenham Hotspur are fourth on 42.
But Arteta believes the championship is not a two-horse race.

‚ÄúI think there are more teams involved and every day is going to be a race ‚Äì a race to convince those players how to train better, to play better,‚Äù he said.

"Gold rebounds from 5-month lows as US dollar, yields retreat","Spot gold gained 0.2% to $1,892.02 per ounce by 0358 GMT, after touching its lowest since mid-March on Thursday. U.S. gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,921.90.","Gold edged up from 5-month lows on Friday as the U.S. dollar and bond yields slightly retreated from highs, but bullion was set for its fourth consecutive weekly decline on concerns the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates higher for longer.
Spot gold gained 0.2% to $1,892.02 per ounce by 0358 GMT, after touching its lowest since mid-March on Thursday. U.S. gold futures rose 0.4% to $1,921.90.
‚ÄúThe U.S. dollar has eased from recent highs and this has allowed gold to make a modest move higher. There is likely some bargain hunting happening for the precious metal at these levels,‚Äù KCM Trade Chief Market Analyst Tim Waterer said.

Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields fell from their highest levels since October, while the dollar index dropped 0.3%, making non-yielding bullion less expensive for overseas buyers.
U.S. 30-year yields also hit 12-year highs on Thursday, as strong economic data raised investor expectations of higher interest rates.
‚ÄúThe dollar will need to take a bearish turn at some point for gold to rediscover its mojo. Just how long gold will spend trading at sub $1,900 levels will depend on how long the dollar remains bolstered by high bond yields,‚Äù Waterer added.
Investors now await Fed Chair Jerome Powell to deliver a talk on the economic outlook on Aug. 25 at the central bankers‚Äô confab in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Wish: This Disney movie tries to find magic in familiarity,"Though the storyline is predictable, the film has several enjoyable moments, songs and catchy lines","Though this new animation film from Disney doesn‚Äôt roll out something absolutely fresh, it pieces together enough feel-good elements from the studio‚Äôs much-loved cinematic universe to showcase the adventures of yet another gritty young woman, Asha (which means ‚Äòhope‚Äô in Hindi). The musical packs oodles of cuteness, several songs, magic and conflicts for a fun ride that would make for a perfect family viewing with young ones.
Riding on nostalgia associated with classic tales, the film boasts of a talented team with Oscar-winning actor Ariana DeBose being cast as Asha; Chris Pine as Magnifico; Angelique Cabral as graceful Queen Amaya and Alan Tudyk as Asha‚Äôs favorite goat, Valentino. The film is helmed by director Chris Buck (‚ÄòFrozen‚Äô and ‚ÄòFrozen 2‚Äô) and Fawn Veerasunthorn (story writer of ‚ÄòRaya and the Last Dragon‚Äô) ‚Äî both of them have successful titles to their credit. Thematically, the film, which celebrates 100 years of Disney, seems to be inspired by the song ‚ÄòWhen You Wish Upon a Star‚Äô that features in the 1940-film Pinocchio.

"ICAI CA Final Nov 2023 Results: ‚ÄòI lost father, grandparents in Covid; they are my guiding angels,‚Äô says (AIR 3) Rishi Malhotra","Rishi wanted to pursue medical field but since his parents wanted him to stay in Jaipur, he opted for Commerce. Although he scored 95.4% in Class 12 board exams, he was unable to get a spot in top 3 DU colleges, and decided to pursue his CA dream.","ICAI CA Final November 2023 Results: Rishi Malhotra scored 590 (73.75 per cent) in the ICAI CA Final November 2023 exam and bagged the All India Rank (AIR) 3. He has shared this position with another boy from Jaipur, Tikendra Kumar Singhal.
This was Malhotra‚Äôs first attempt at the CA Final exam in which he appeared for both groups. When he started preparing for his CA journey in 2019, little did he know that he would have to face so many difficulties. ‚ÄúI lost my father, grandfather and my grandmother to Covid within a week. This was when I was doing my articleship at E&Y, Delhi office. All of this happened so quickly that I had to rush back to Jaipur to be there for my family. Since both my elder sisters are married, I decided to quit E&Y, and got an internship at KPMG, Jaipur,‚Äù he shared with indianexpress.com. Rishi still works at the same company.
During the second pandemic wave, the 22-year-old was admitted to the hospital due to Covid. Even though it was difficult for him to bounce back to normalcy, he did not give up hope. ‚ÄúWhen I started my CA journey in 2019, I wanted to go to one of the top three Delhi University colleges, but since I didn‚Äôt get through, I decided to at least bring laurels in Chartered Accountancy. I knew I had to make my family proud, and losing my three beloved family members in the Covid reminded me of my goal. Those three are my guiding angels and it is because of them that I got the strength to achieve this rank today,‚Äù he reminisced.
READ | ICAI CA Final Results 2023
Rishi‚Äôs mother currently works as a director at the Pension Office of the Rajasthan Government, and his sisters work at Siemens AG (Pune) and Dell Inc (Bengaluru). The three women gave him strength and support to continue this journey, he added.
ICAI CA Results: Revision and self-notes are important
Even though Rishi took coaching classes during his CA journey, he wrapped up those classes a year before appearing for the Final exam and concentrated on his revision. What helped him the most, he says, is the notes that he prepared on his own.
‚ÄúI had a target of having only three registers of notes for each attempt. Irrespective of how many books the ICAI has prescribed, I ensured that I maintained only three registers keeping the last day revision in mind. I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt have the time to go through so many pages a day before the exam, so I shortened everything. I would write the important concepts, and then under that cut and paste the questions from books, and then write the answer myself. This technique helped me understand and remember concepts and questions properly,‚Äù he explained.

Rishi added he relied on the ICAI study material to prepare his notes.
Another thing that Rishi believes is important to ace the CA final exam is mock tests and revision. The Jaipur boy claims he solved 4-5 test series repeatedly, which ultimately totalled to nearly 20 revisions in the last year. He ensured that he stayed focused and disciplined when it came to revision.
‚ÄúAttempting mock tests and doing multiple rounds of revisions helps you understand your strengths and weaknesses. It helps you realise which part of the syllabus and question paper will take more time and which is the part that you can solve quickly. With nearly 20 rounds of revision, I could remember exactly what the page of the book looked like as soon as I saw the question. So, it is important to do multiple revisions on your own if you want clarity on concepts, basics and a good score,‚Äù he added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/education/icai-ca-final-results-i-lost-father-grandparents-in-covid-they-are-my-guiding-angels-says-air-3-rishi-malhotra-9101418/,education
"PSG ‚Äòhaving conversations with Messi about contract extension‚Äô, Barcelona comeback may not happen","In the absence of Neymar and Mbappe, Messi had lighted up the field in PSG's 3-1 win over Montpellier last week.","‚ÄúCalm down.‚Äù Those were the two words Lionel Messi uttered to the Paris Saint Germain sports advisor Luis Campos at halftime against Montpellier. With no Mbappe or Neymar in the squad, the Parisians relied on their World Cup winning forward to guide them to a win in Ligue 1.
‚ÄúI remember what I said to Messi at halftime against Montpellier: ‚ÄòYou have to lead everyone else‚Äô. He replied: ‚ÄòCalm down‚Äô. And he had an exceptional second half,‚Äù Campos told Mundo Deportivo.
Messi scored in a 3-1 win for the visitors to further solidify their case for the domestic title after a couple of hiccups since the league‚Äôs resumption post World Cup that included a 3-1 defeat to Racing Club de Lens. In light of his recent performance, the questions on his future at the club have been asked. Messi joined PSG in the summer of 2021 on a two-year deal and with his contract set to expire, Campos has now revealed that the club is working on an extension.
‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre having conversations with Messi about his contract extension. I‚Äôd like to keep him in the project, I‚Äôm not going to hide it. We‚Äôre talking right now to achieve this goal and continue having him with us,‚Äù the PSG sports advisor confessed.
Messi joined PSG from Barcelona after the latter failed to offer him a contract owing to financial crisis from extravagant expenditure on transfer markets and player wages over the past few seasons leading to enormous debts.
The Argentina captain is the reason why PSG are still confident of the upcoming few games despite French star Kylian Mbappe being ruled out of action due to injury.

‚ÄúLosing Kylian is of course very hard. I saw him very sad after the injury, but I also saw him working to speed up his recovery as soon as possible. That is the personality of the winners,‚Äù Campos said.

On the third player who completes the French club‚Äôs ultimate forward trio, the PSG sports advisor added, ‚ÄúSince my arrival at PSG I have not had any criticism to make of Neymar. He is always punctual and has a good disposition. This Neymar is an incredible Neymar‚Äù
However, Campos is well aware that for PSG to achieve their first ever Champions League title aside from domestic success, it‚Äôll take more than their front three.

Meta‚Äôs Canada news ban fails to dent Facebook usage,"The company ended news sharing in Canada on its services at the beginning of August, while Google has said it plans to block news from search results in Canada once the law comes into effect.","Meta‚Äôs decision to block news links in Canada this month has had almost no impact on Canadians‚Äô usage of Facebook, data from independent tracking firms indicated on Tuesday, as the company faces scorching criticism from the Canadian government over the move.
Daily active users of Facebook and time spent on the app in Canada have stayed roughly unchanged since parent company Meta started blocking news there at the start of August, according to data shared by Similarweb, a digital analytics company that tracks traffic on websites and apps, at Reuters‚Äô request.
Another analytics firm, Data.ai, likewise told Reuters that its data was not showing any meaningful change to usage of the platform in Canada in August.
ADVERTISEMENT
The estimates, while early, appear to support Meta‚Äôs contention that news holds little value for the company as it remains locked in a tense standoff in Canada over a new law requiring internet giants to pay publishers for the news articles shared on their platforms.
Meta declined to comment on the estimates.

The Online News Act, passed by the Canadian parliament in June, forces platforms like Meta and Google parent Alphabet to negotiate commercial deals with Canadian news publishers for use of their content. Both Meta and Alphabet‚Äôs Google have said the law is unworkable for their businesses. Meta, in particular, has said links to news articles make up less than 3% of the content on its Facebook feeds and have no economic value to the company. The world‚Äôs biggest social media company has been trying to reduce the prevalence of news and other civic content on its platforms in recent years as it faces regulatory pressure in key markets around the world. Instead, it aims to promote lighter subjects like fashion, entertainment and sports.
The shift has resulted in a dramatic reduction in news consumption via social media, according to recent reports by the Reuters Institute and Pew Research Center.
Even before Meta pulled the plug on news links in Canada, Facebook referrals to a sampling of popular news sites in Canada were already down about 35% year-over-year in July and about 74% since 2020, according to Similarweb.
ADVERTISEMENT
Still, the company‚Äôs own transparency reports suggest news remains some of the most popular content on Facebook when it is there, at least in the United States, the only country for which Meta discloses the most frequently viewed content.
According to its most recent report, news websites made up 13 of the top 20 domains viewed on Facebook in the United States in the first quarter, while 18 of the top 20 individual links were to news articles.
Meta‚Äôs other big social platform Instagram is less of a presence in the news environment as it does not enable links within individual user posts.

Canadian government officials have accused Meta of brinkmanship in wiping its platforms of news in a moment of heightened need in Canada as wildfires force thousands of people from their homes, even as quiet negotiations over those rules continue behind the scenes.
Specific rules addressing how the law will be implemented are due to be released by late December, after which point the platforms would be expected to finalize deals with publishers.
Canada‚Äôs new Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge has spoken to both Facebook and Google since taking office after a cabinet shuffle at the end of July, her office told Reuters.
A Meta spokesperson confirmed the talks. The Canadian regulator responsible for implementing the country‚Äôs online news law said on Thursday that it would start setting up a framework for negotiations between news organizations and internet giants this autumn, with the aim of initiating mandatory bargaining by early 2025.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/metas-canada-news-ban-fails-to-dent-facebook-usage-8916258/,technology

The interim committee will be under the supervision of Zee‚Äôs board, a company spokesperson said.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India in June banned Chandra and Goenka from holding board positions in publicly listed companies for a year, alleging they were actively involved in diverting funds to the group‚Äôs other listed entities and firms related to founding shareholders.

Jones is the second Saints manager to lose his job this season after the former Luton Town boss was appointed in November as Ralph Hasenhuettl‚Äôs replacement.
While the Saints reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and the semi-finals of the League Cup, the club failed to get out of the relegation zone in the league and remain rooted at the bottom of the table.
In their last eight league games, Southampton‚Äôs sole victory came against a similarly struggling Everton last month.
Jones‚Äôs last game in charge was Saturday‚Äôs defeat by 10-man Wolverhampton Wanderers who came back from a goal down to win 2-1 to leave the Saints on 15 points in 22 games, four points from the safety zone.

"These microbial heroes are saving corals from climate change, finds study",Scientists have discovered that the presence of a certain single-celled microbe could be key to the survival of some corals.,"Not all heroes wear capes, especially the ones that are single-celled microbes. Researchers discovered for the first time that the presence of certain microbes can tell them whether the coral will survive heat stress, often brought about by climate change.
‚ÄúThis is the first time that a non-algae microbe has been shown to influence the ability of corals to survive a heat-stress event. As corals face more and more heat-stress events due to climate change, a better understanding of all the microbes that may influence survivability can inform conservation practitioners as to which corals they should prioritize for intervention, said the study‚Äôs senior author Javier del Campo, in a press statement.

How Humane‚Äôs AI Pin reminds one of iPod Shuffle‚Äôs attempts to offer a screen-less future,Apple first attempted to venture into the realm of screen-less devices with the third-generation iPod Shuffle way back in 2009.,"When Humane‚Äôs AI Pin debuted last week, it sparked a whole new conversation about the elusive dream of creating screen-less devices. However, it was Apple that first attempted to venture into the realm of screen-less devices with the third-generation iPod Shuffle way back in 2009. Although Apple no longer sells the iPod Shuffle, that one device was a precursor to what could possibly be the user interface of the future, allowing you to clip the tiny MP3 player to your shirt and control the music player through an innovative voice-and-remote interface.
Humane AI Pin is pitched as a phone replacement without a screen. (Image credit: Humane)
The iPod Shuffle entered the market at a time when Apple‚Äôs hip music player had already become a pop cultural phenomenon. Sales of the iPod were skyrocketing, and Apple was a few years away from unveiling the iPhone. On January 11, 2005, just minutes before Apple CEO Steve Jobs concluded his Macworld keynote at the Moscone Center, he addressed a packed audience by announcing the iPod Shuffle for the first time as ‚ÄúOne more thing‚Äù. This device was different from the iPod we knew ‚Äî it looked like a pack of Wrigley‚Äôs gum ‚Äî no click wheel, no screen, no hard disk. One might have wondered if the Shuffle was even an iPod.
However, in Steve Jobs‚Äô mind, the Shuffle was aimed at low-cost flash memory-based players, offering not only a huge growth opportunity for Apple but also serving as an entry into the Apple ecosystem. The iPod Shuffle sold for $99 and $149, depending on the storage configuration. While the Shuffle lacked a display to show what song was playing, it did connect with the iTunes software, like other iPods in the lineup. However, what stood out about the Shuffle was its ability to play a set of music at random, hence the name Shuffle.

While many thought the Shuffle would be a one-off product for Apple, Jobs had something else in mind. Apple continued to launch the iPod Shuffle, starting with its introduction, and the last significant update came out in 2010. The second-generation iPod Shuffle was a departure from the first-generation model. It was much smaller, and, in fact, one could wear it through a smaller clip. To reduce the size and make it more compact, Apple had to bring several design changes, like ditching the USB plug and replacing it with a dock that synced data via the headphone port. That iPod Shuffle came in a host of fun colours.
But in 2009, with the introduction of the third-generation iPod Shuffle, Apple stunned everyone. That model was not only the smallest iPod Shuffle but also the first buttonless iPod ever. It was 1.8 inches tall and 0.3 inches thin, being half the size of its predecessor while offering more storage. The $79 third-generation model came with no display, like other iPod Shuffles in the past, and had a premium design made of aluminum but ditched the physical controls, replaced by the in-line controls of the bundled pair of earphones, with the only exception of a small slider that let you pick between playing songs in order, shuffling, and switching it off.

From the very beginning, the iPod was all about the user interface. The first-generation iPod had a click wheel, a simple and uncluttered way to control the music. In retrospect, the click wheel allowed users to use the iPod without looking at the screen. The click wheel was a departure from how devices were controlled even then, and to some extent now, which may have improved interfaces and use sophisticated touch screens but require constant attention while you interact with them.
But like the original iPod, the third-generation iPod Shuffle was the polar opposite ‚Äî a breakthrough device, but unfortunately, Apple didn‚Äôt get much credit. The third-generation iPod Shuffle brought a brand-new text-to-speech system that helped users navigate their music, as well as a new remote control that Apple embedded in the earbud cord. Essentially, Apple removed the controls from the iPod itself and moved them to the remote on the headphones. It was a different experience of using the iPod Shuffle‚Äîa non-traditional way of how people used to interact with their iPods. Press it once to pause the music; twice to skip to the next track; three times to go to the last track; press and hold to hear the artist and song title; press twice and hold to fast-forward; press three times and hold to fast-reverse. On paper, putting all the controls on the headphones may sound nightmarish, but in reality, the interface was very intuitive.

The iPod Shuffle 3rd generation was a peak into the screenless devices‚Äô future.
But where the third-generation iPod Shuffle shone was its ability to be completely invisible in the way you control and interact with the music player. Apple introduced something called VoiceOver with that model, which allowed the iPod to read information about what‚Äôs playing, such as reading you the name of the song and artist of the current song, and giving users the ability to choose different playlists. All it required was a long press on the remote‚Äôs center button, and the Shuffle started reading the names of your playlists; release it when you hear the one you want to select.
Not only did VoiceOver make the iPod Shuffle an even more interesting product, but it also, in a way, compensated for the lack of a display to control playback. That being said, VoiceOver wasn‚Äôt a complete replacement for what a display can do, and Apple understood it. The third-generation Shuffle met with a lukewarm response, and the reason was pretty understandable. Despite being a forward-looking device, the Shuffle was limited in features and functionalities; locating a particular song was nearly impossible, and the device wasn‚Äôt designed to sort all the songs in alphabetical order; the Shuffle didn‚Äôt understand the concept of albums.
Apple‚Äôs new VoiceOver feature enabled the iPod to speak your song titles, artists and playlist names.
Sure, Apple was looking at a button-less future with the iPod Shuffle, but there were too many complexities. Many people found the iPod Shuffle 3rd gen confusing to use, and Apple had published a 4-minute video tour walking users through the controls and features as a rescue measure. However, one thing that irked many people about the third-generation model was that there were no other headphones on the market that had playback controls on a remote that worked with the Shuffle.
Apple‚Äôs experiment with the button-less iPod came to an end with the fourth-generation iPod Shuffle. The company caved in and put buttons back on the iPod, though this time the combination of the remote and VoiceOver was actually successful.

The screen-less device future had been in the works for years, but it‚Äôs not easy to crack, as it comes with many caveats. Humane‚Äôs AI Pin is taking the same direction as Apple once did with the third-generation iPod Shuffle. As history tells us, it‚Äôs not easy to ditch buttons and screens on devices yet.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/how-humanes-ai-pin-reminds-one-of-ipod-shuffles-attempts-to-offer-a-screen-less-future-9032944/,technology

The net profit ‚Äî which came on the back of a boost in refining and marketing margin ‚Äî compared to a loss of Rs 272.35 crore in July-September 2022, according to a stock exchange filing by the company.
Besides robust refining margins, the profit was aided by a boost in marketing margins as a freeze on petrol and diesel price revision despite a fall in input crude oil prices helped recover losses incurred when rates were high last year.

Pre-tax earnings from the sale of petroleum products soared to Rs 17,755.95 crore in the second quarter of the current fiscal compared to Rs 104.04 crore in the same period last year.
Last year, state-owned fuel retailers IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) froze prices despite a spike in global oil prices following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. This was with a view to insulate consumers from price volatility.
The price freeze led to the three firms incurring losses in the first half of the 2022-23 fiscal (April 2022 to March 2023). IOC incurred a loss of Rs 2,264.88 crore in April-September 2022. This year, it, however, posted record earnings of Rs 26,717.76 crore in April-September 2023, more than the Rs 24,184 crore record net profit the company had posted in 2021-22.
Its revenues fell to Rs 2.02 lakh crore in July-September from Rs 2.28 lakh crore last year on lower oil prices.

IOC said it earned USD 13.12 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel in April-September 2023 against a gross refining margin of USD 25.49 in the corresponding period last year. It did not give quarterly refining margins.
The company sold 21.941 million tonnes of petroleum products in the September quarter, up from 21.562 million tonnes last year but lower than 23.305 million tonnes sales in the preceding quarter.

‚ÄúSeriously, FIFA, is this the fan engagement ambassador we need as the (Women‚Äôs World Cup) approaches?‚Äù wrote Moya Dodd, who was part of the co-hosting bid campaign for her native Australia and New Zealand, on her Twitter account.
Dodd, a former FIFA executive committee member and longtime advocate for women‚Äôs soccer, used the hashtag ‚Äútonedeaf‚Äù and posted the glamor photo from the profile of Lima‚Äôs Twitter account that has 2.4 million followers.
A former Australia national-team player, Dodd also recalled recent speculation FIFA could sign the Saudi Arabia tourism board as an official sponsor of the month-long tournament that starts July 20.

‚ÄúHonestly baffled by the marketing strategy. First FIFA wants to send an LGBTQ-friendly audience to ‚ÄòVisit Saudi‚Äô,‚Äù Dodd wrote. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs targeting who exactly?‚Äù
Lima was photographed Monday in Paris at the FIFA gala event with its president Gianni Infantino and posted on Twitter her new role ‚Äúmeans the world to me.‚Äù

She also posted to her 15.4 million followers on Instagram: ‚ÄúIt is a great honor to be part of the FIFA Family.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs a fan myself, I hope to connect at a greater level this family to the life of this beautiful sport: the fans!‚Äù she wrote.
FIFA did not specify details Monday of the projects involving Lima, nor if it would involve the biggest-ever marquee women‚Äôs tournament which now has 32 teams.
‚ÄúWhen you get to meet Adriana, you feel right away her warmth, kindness, and how approachable and passionate she is about our game,‚Äù Infantino said Monday in the FIFA statement.

‚ÄúShe lives and breathes ‚Äòfutebol‚Äô and that is also why she can be an excellent link between FIFA and fans worldwide,‚Äù he said.
FIFA noted Lima is a ‚Äúsupermodel, actress and businesswoman‚Äù but offered no details about her links to the sport besides being a fan. Lima posted her condolences after Pel√©‚Äôs death in December.
Infantino and Dodd served together on FIFA‚Äôs ruling committee for more than a year after he was elected in 2016.
She was the first woman, in 2013, to represent the Asian soccer confederation at FIFA and gained a reputation as an independent voice during the presidency of Sepp Blatter. Dodd lost her re-election bid four years later to an opponent from Bangladesh.

After the Indians dismissed the visitors for 177, thanks to the spin wizardry of Ravindra Jadeja (who took five for 47) and Ravichandran Ashwin (three for 42) it was skipper Rohit who led from the front, getting to his half century off just 66 balls. Thanks to his knock, India were trailing the Aussies by just 100 runs at the end of Day 1.
While Rohit rarely broke into a sweat during his innings, at the other end, fellow opener KL Rahul laboured his way to a 71-ball 20, an innings where he never really looked at ease. Finally, a delivery from Todd Murphy got him to hand back an easy catch to the debutant and end his stint at the crease. Ashwin, sent up the order at No 3, was yet to get on the scoreboard after facing five balls when the day ended.
IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 1, Innings update
So, the Australians have been skittled out for 177 in the first innings of the first Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test, thanks to the craft of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin. The former was the most lethal at Nagpur, not just because he ended the innings with five wickets, but also because he took the ones that really mattered the most for the hosts. He picked up the scalps of Marnus Labuschagne (out for 49) and Steve Smith (dismissed for 37), both set batters, who, at one stage, were threatening to take the game away from India‚Äôs grasp.
For Jadeja personally, this is more than just about the five wickets. He is making a comeback at Nagpur after having been out of national team since August last year due to a right knee injury which he sustained during the Asia Cup.
There was another brief phase of resistance, where Peter Handscomb (31) and Alex Carey (36) tried to hold the fort. But Ashwin got the better of both of them.
IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 1 Tea update
It took just one session and the magic of Ravindra Jadeja for all of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith‚Äôs perseverance to unravel. The Australian duo had managed to pull the visitors back from the brink to take them into lunch at 76 for 2.
Just when Labuschagne was starting to drag Australia into a position of power, Jadeja intervened, getting him out for 49. He lured the batter into his trap, first bowling quicker ones, then a slower one inviting him to drive. Labuschagne could not resist taking the bait. Before he knew it, KS Bharat had whipped off his bails. One ball later, Matt Renshaw was walking back to the hut after Jadeja got him LBW.
He then came for the other set batter, getting Smith bowled as Australia slumped to 109 for 5 having started the session 76 for 2.

Ravichandran Ashwin, not one to be left behind, then came and scalped two wickets of his own. Australia went to the tea break at 178 for 8.
IND vs AUS 1st Test Day 1 Lunch update
After an early wobble at the start of the innings, it took the calm reassuring presence of Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith to help see out the first session for the visitors on Day 1 of the first Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Labuschagne was batting on 47 while Smith had made a patient 19 off 74 balls at lunch at Nagpur to help Australia reach 76 for 2.

It took just six overs for spin to be introduced on the first day of the first Test of what promises to be a mouthwatering four-Test series. Ravindra Jadeja was handed the ball on his comeback to the national team after five months of being on the sidelines to a right knee injury. In the three overs they split before that, the Indian pace duo of Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami had made inroads into the Australian top order.
Siraj dismissed Usman Khawaja in the second over itself, an LBW call that was initially given not out, but was overturned by the TV umpire. One over later, Shami sent David Warner‚Äôs stump cartwheeling with a peach of a delivery. Australia slumped to 2 for 2 in the third over.

"Harry Kane‚Äôs milestone goal gives Tottenham win against Manchester City, helps Arsenal too","The England captain's milestone strike earned Tottenham a 1-0 win Sunday over Manchester City, which was looking for a victory to trim the gap to Premier League leader Arsenal to two points.","Harry Kane broke Tottenham‚Äôs all-time scoring record with a goal ‚Äî his 267th for the club ‚Äî that will have been celebrated almost as jubilantly by the other team in north London.
The England captain‚Äôs milestone strike earned Tottenham a 1-0 win Sunday over Manchester City, which was looking for a victory to trim the gap to Premier League leader Arsenal to two points.
In the end, Arsenal wasn‚Äôt punished for losing 1-0 at Everton on Saturday ‚Äî and maybe that‚Äôs no surprise. After all, City now hasn‚Äôt won, or even scored, in five games at Tottenham‚Äôs new stadium in either the Premier League or the Champions League.

Even the absence of Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, recovering in his native Italy after having his gallbladder removed this week, couldn‚Äôt change the narrative around this particular fixture.
Kane swept home the winner in the 15th minute after Pierre-Emile H√∏jbjerg intercepted a pass out from the back by City midfielder Rodri and set up the striker to score his 200th Premier League goal. Only two other players ‚Äî Alan Shearer (260) and Wayne Rooney (208) ‚Äî have reached that figure.
Kane broke the tie for all-time Tottenham goals he had with the late Jimmy Greaves, who played for the club from 1961-70.
City was the architect of its own downfall for the goal, just as it was when conceding two sloppy first-half goals against Tottenham last month before rallying for a 4-2 win at Etihad Stadium.

City lost for the fourth time this season in the league and stayed five points behind Arsenal, which has a game in hand as it bids for a first top-flight title since 2004.

The Mission review: Devotion leads an American missionary to his death in the Andamans,"The Mission movie review: National Geographic's new documentary captures the obsession, devotion and delusion that led American missionary John Allen Chau to his death in the Andaman Islands.","One of the most gut-wrenching scenes in all of modern cinema comes at the end of Werner Herzog‚Äôs 2005 documentary, Grizzly Man. The film tells the tragic story of Timothy Treadwell, an outdoorsy American man who made the mistake ‚Äî as so many of Herzog‚Äôs protagonists do ‚Äî of staring into the abyss without bothering to consider the consequences. Treadwell was killed by a grizzly bear that he‚Äôd deluded himself into thinking he could tame. They recovered audio of the fatal attack, which Herzog listens to on camera in the film, but crucially, restricts from the audience. It distressed him to the point that he instructed Treadwell‚Äôs ex-girlfriend to destroy it immediately.
Directors Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss perhaps came across a similar ethical dilemma in their new film, The Mission, which in many ways can be seen as a thematic companion piece to Grizzly Man. Like Herzog‚Äôs classic, the documentary follows the exploits of another adventurer ‚Äî the Evangelical missionary John Allen Chau ‚Äî who got more than what he bargained for after making illegal contact with the Sentinelese tribe in the Andaman Islands. The Sentinelese are perhaps the world‚Äôs most isolated community, having fended away almost all attempts at communication by the outside world.

Chau, a mixed-race American who grew up in the ‚Äò90s, slowly became obsessed with the idea of converting the Sentinelese to Christianity. He believed that the island was Satan‚Äôs last great stronghold, and that only he could bring the Gospel of Christ to the 200-odd people who are said to live there. Chau wasn‚Äôt always a religious zealot, however. He grew up on The Adventures of Tintin and Robinson Crusoe, but found himself drifting away from conventional pop-culture in his teens, as he became completely entrenched in the Evangelical movement.
Chau‚Äôs life story is recounted in gorgeously animated sequences by his own father, who openly blames the Evangelicals for what happened to him. Chau was aware that the Indian government had forbidden all contact with the Sentinelese. He also knew that several past expeditions had ended with the Sentinelese giving clear warning signs to incoming explorers by aiming arrows at them. One of the most enduring images of the tribe ‚Äî this also gives the film‚Äôs producers, National Geographic, a chance to offer internal critique about the west‚Äôs messiah complex ‚Äî forever painting them as the savages in the eyes of the ‚Äòcivilised‚Äô world.
The movie makes an honest attempt at capturing the complex blend of obsession, devotion, and delusion that sent John Allen Chau on his suicide mission. Perhaps the most interesting interviewee ‚Äî the movie also features one of Chau‚Äôs old friends, and his many enablers from the Evangelical community ‚Äî is the linguist Daniel Everett, who sees in Chau a kindred spirit, and harbours a vague sense of guilt over what happened to him. Everett spent decades with the Pirah√£ people of the Amazon, initially with the intention of teaching them the Lord‚Äôs ways. But in an unexpected turn of events, he found his own faith crumbling when the Pirah√£ started resisting his lessons.
He‚Äôs a fascinating character, someone who tears up at the mere memory of an old aphorism ‚Äî ‚ÄúHe gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.‚Äù ‚Äî and freely admits that his three-decade mission might have been a waste of time. Whatever statements that The Mission is unable to make in literal terms, it makes by awarding Everett a large chunk of the screen time. But he isn‚Äôt a martyr, not like Chau.

We see endless self-shot footage of Chau climbing mountains, jumping into rivers, scurrying along narrow forest paths ‚Äî visuals that could ostensibly project him as a ‚Äòregular‚Äô person. But Everett offers perhaps the film‚Äôs most sobering observation, when he warns that Chau‚Äôs reckless actions might inspire others to make similar illegal incursions into forbidden territory. It‚Äôs a dangerous proposition, and as one person keenly notes, none of this takes into consideration what the Sentinelese might want.

Odisha FC play out 2-2 draw with Chennaiyin FC,Chennaiyn FC's seventh game without a win meant they cannot afford to drop points in their last four games if they want to stay in playoff contention.,"Odisha FC played out a 2-2 draw with Chennaiyin FC to move back to sixth place in the Indian Super League table here on Thursday.
Odisha (22 points) now have a point ahead of Bengaluru FC, while Chennaiyin FC are five points behind them in eighth.
Chennaiyin FC began the game on the front foot, challenging Odisha FC with a high press. After a period of minor threats, they finally found space down the right from where Anirudh Thapa found Vincy Barretto‚Äôs diving header in the 19th minute.
But, Amrinder Singh made the first of his three big saves in the game, stretching to his left to tip it wide.

It was Odisha FC who broke the deadlock in what turned into a lively first half.
In the 24th minute, Chennaiyin FC‚Äôs miskicked long ball from the back was intercepted by Odisha FC‚Äôs high line, and with two touches, they found Diego Mauricio in the box via Isak Ralte‚Äôs through ball. The striker‚Äôs powerful left footer on the run found back of net.
But Thapa was on hand to find an equalizer the very next minute. Odisha FC were caught unawares, allowing Thapa to run in between the defenders as Aakash Sangwan found him with an inch-perfect cross from the left flank that was headed in from close range.
In the final few minutes of the first half, both Peter Sliskovic and Abdenasser El Khayati threatened to score, with the latter being denied on a long shot by Amrinder.

But once again, it was Odisha FC who went ahead minutes into the second half. This time, it was Chennaiyin FC‚Äôs defence that wasn‚Äôt alert to a run into the box.
Nandhakumar Sekar was allowed time on the right flank to put in a low cross as Isak slipped into the six yard box to slot the ball into the net.
Chennaiyin FC took control of the game again from there. In the 56th minute, they found another equaliser through El Khayati. Barreto‚Äôs run down the left seemed to have ended in a feeble cross, but the ball bounced back into the path of El Khayati who took a calm touch before placing his shot to beat Amrinder.
Amrinder put his body on the line in the 67th minute to deny substitute Kwame Karikari from close range, and El Khayati nearly pulled off a goal-of-the-season candidate when he curled a long-range shot with a short backlift only to find the post. That was their last substantial chance to win the game.

‚ÄúA couple of years ago when I was in the fourth round I was really exhausted, and right now I feel this is the right place to be,‚Äù Swiatek said.

Nadal‚Äôs conqueror Mackenzie McDonald could not continue his run however, as the unseeded American fell to Japan‚Äôs Yoshihito Nishioka who won 7-6(6) 6-3 6-2, though fellow Americans Sebastian Korda and Frances Tiafoe are all in action later in the day.

No male U.S. player has captured a Grand Slam title since Andy Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open, but the country‚Äôs hopes had been rekindled with eight players in the third round.

Organisers will hope the swift victories continue in the evening having defended their scheduling following a late finish to the previous day after former world number one Andy Murray beat Thanasi Kokkinakis in a five-set epic.
That match finished at 4.05 a.m. (1705 GMT on Thursday) and Murray described the late finish as a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù
Tournament director Craig Tiley ruled out immediate changes after Murray said tennis must aim to avoid late finishes.
‚ÄúAt this point there‚Äôs no need to change the schedule,‚Äù Tiley said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll always look at it, when we do the debrief ‚Äî like we do every year.

Is this the right time to play Ranji Trophy?,Ranji Trophy will fight for relevance once again with a Test series against England and India A games in progress at the same time.,"The Sanatana Dharma ground in scenic Alappuzha, a tourist hub, is where one of India‚Äôs best spinners Kuldeep Yadav will begin this first class season ‚Äî playing for Uttar Pradesh against Kerala.
How many games the left-arm wrist spinner will play in the country‚Äôs premier first-class tournament is anybody‚Äôs guess.
Ranji Trophy is being played in the middle of a packed schedule.
A five-match Test series against England begins on January 25. A shadow tour of the England Lions versus India A begins on January 12 in Ahmedabad, the same day as the second round of Ranji Trophy matches commence. Fringe players knocking on doors of the Test team will be part of the India A squad, while the best will be donning Test whites.
Not for the first time in an era when T20 cricket is the holy grail and the IPL a quick route to entry into the national side, Ranji Trophy ‚Äî which runs till early February ‚Äî will struggle for relevance.
Not since the 2016/17 home season so India have as many as 13 Tests lined-up this year. But the diluted Ranji Trophy, sans the best of the rest outside the core of the Test squad, may not be the best yardstick to judge performance for selectors to build a bench for the Test squad.
Coaches of domestic teams are a worried lot.
Rotate ‚ÄòA‚Äô squad
To prevent Ranji Trophy matches from being a watered-down affair because of India A engagements that run till February 4 and to have key personnel available, some of the coaches have asked selectors to at least rotate the players.
ADVERTISEMENT
With the tournament now held in the second-half of the season; December to February instead of end of September to early January ‚Äî several coaches complain how players, especially fast-bowlers, cite slight niggles to skip games as they don‚Äôt want to risk missing out on the IPL, which usually begins in early April.
That the visiting England Lions team has only three Test-capped players, in Ollie Robinson, Keaton Jennings and Alex Lees, isn‚Äôt lost on them. India A should be an emerging team comprising Under-23 players, suggests a coach.
‚ÄúEngland and Australia will never schedule A series when County cricket or Sheffield Shield is on. When we tour these countries, we do it in the off-season or in the pre-season. This series (England Lions versus India A) could have been played in December. But now we have to lose our players,‚Äù another veteran coach said.
But from the national team‚Äôs perspective, it is easy to understand why this A series is important. With this being a shadow tour (played alongside the five Test matches between India and England) and coming at the end of a long season that included a World Cup, there are concerns about the fitness of a few Test players.
ADVERTISEMENT
Two of India‚Äôs best spinners aren‚Äôt young anymore and the workload may take a toll. And given there are at least four young batsmen in the Test squad, the selectors feel they need to keep the reserves ready. Matches against the England Lions will be key.
But if the Future Tours Programme is prepared in advance, can‚Äôt the domestic calendar be planned accordingly. The IPL has forced a change.
Before the Covid years, the Ranji was usually slotted to begin from September end or October first week. But with IPL auctions usually scheduled during this time, the BCCI advanced the Syed Mushtaq Ali and with Ranji Trophy pushed further down.
There are benefits, says WV Raman, former India opener and ex coach of Bengal and Tamil Nadu.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWhen you start the tournament early (Sep-Oct), except for the western side, rain will be a factor in other places because of the north-east monsoon. While fog will be an issue in December-January in the northern belt, it doesn‚Äôt hamper as much and as the tournament progresses into the last leg, it would only get better. Nowhere in the world can we have conditions which will be ideal for everything,‚Äù Raman told The Indian Express.
Playing in this period also means, most of the matches are played on surfaces which have good grass cover, enabling lateral movement and aiding fast bowlers. Sans enough sunshine, pitches usually don‚Äôt break easily and have shown a tendency to flatten as the game progresses in some places, which isn‚Äôt a common occurrence at the top level.
‚ÄúOf course during this phase there is nippy movement in some places with bowlers usually enjoying the conditions. You will have moisture in the surface that would aid movement, but you aren‚Äôt playing in one particular zone. You get to play in different conditions and build your game,‚Äù Raman added.
The Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, the domestic T20 tournament, has relevance because it is a talent-spotting opportunity for IPL scouts before an auction. Playing in the shadow of a high-profile Test series and India A games, the onus will be on a special player to catch the attention of the selectors during the Ranji Trophy.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/is-this-the-right-time-to-play-ranji-trophy-2024-preview-9095568/,sports

This strategic shift, coupled with the imposition of tariffs, underscores India‚Äôs determination to minimise dependency on imports and prioritise the development of its domestic manufacturing capacity.

Neshwin Rodrigues, an India Electricity Policy Analyst at Ember, said, ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs dependence on China for solar module imports is well and truly reducing post-2022. Domestic manufacturing is gaining momentum, thanks to recent policy interventions.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs India edges closer to self-sufficiency in solar manufacturing, reliance on Chinese modules and cells is no longer a constraint. What‚Äôs crucial now is creating an enabling policy environment to ensure that solar installations keep pace with the National Electricity Plan,‚Äù he said.
India started levying a customs duty of 40 per cent on solar modules and 25 per cent on solar cells from April 2022 in a bid to cut imports and boost local manufacturing.
The country‚Äôs commitment to reducing import dependency and nurturing a robust domestic solar manufacturing ecosystem aligns with the nation‚Äôs broader goals of sustainability and energy self-reliance.
According to its updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which are national plans to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, India has committed to achieving 500 GW of installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel-based resources by 2030. Solar is at the heart of this ambitious goal.

The report also said China‚Äôs exports of solar panels rose by an impressive 3 per cent in the first half of 2023, reaching a total of 114 GW shipped worldwide.
This marks a substantial increase from the 85 GW exported during the same period in the previous year.
Ember‚Äôs data lead, Sam Hawkins, said, ‚ÄúSolar growth is going through the roof.‚Äù China‚Äôs dominance in the solar panel manufacturing market, accounting for about 80 per cent of the global market share, has significant global implications.
ADVERTISEMENT
More than half of the solar modules exported from China during the first half of 2023 were destined for Europe, making up 52.5 per cent of exports.
Europe experienced the most substantial absolute growth worldwide, with exports from China increasing by 47 per cent year-on-year (21 GW), reaching a total of 65 GW during the first half of 2023 compared to 44 GW in the same period the previous year.
While Europe led in absolute growth, the fastest expansion occurred in Africa and the Middle East.
South Africa witnessed a remarkable increase of 438 per cent (2.7 GW) in solar panel imports from China in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period last year.
This surge contributed to Africa‚Äôs overall growth of 187 per cent (3.7 GW), making it the fastest-growing region.
ADVERTISEMENT
Following Africa, the Middle East experienced a 64 per cent growth (2.4 GW) during the first half of 2023 compared to the previous year.
The report noted that despite the surge in solar panel exports, the gap between solar module exports and installed PV capacity is widening globally. This is attributed to stockpiling of modules in warehouses and challenges related to the installation and grid integration of solar generation.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sam Hawkins, data lead at Ember, emphasised the need to accelerate installation and grid integration to keep pace with the global module supply, saying, ‚ÄúWe have enough solar panels; we just need to get busy installing them.‚Äù He called for policies that prioritise the rapid scaling of installation and grid integration to match the increasing module supply.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/india-slashes-solar-imports-china-domestic-manufacturing-thrives-8939337/,business
Indian tectonic plate that causes Himalayas to grow could be splitting Tibet,"Tibet might be splitting in half as the Indian continental plate crashes into the Eurasian plate, causing the Himalayas to grow.","The Indian tectonic plate‚Äôs movement causes the Himalayas to grow but the same process may also be tearing apart Tibet into two, geophysicists have discovered.
It was already understood that the Himalayas are growing because the Indian and Eurasian continental tectonic plates are colliding under the mountain range, according to LiveScience. Usually, when two tectonic plates collide, the denser one usually slides beneath the other in a phenomenon called subduction. However, since the two continental plates are similarly dense, geoscientists are not quite sure which plate is going to end up on top of another.

In an interview with News9 Live, RGV said that Animal reminded him of Scorsese‚Äôs The Wolf of Wall Street. ‚ÄúThe last film I saw where the director himself is not being judgemental about the character was Wolf of Wall Street. Leonardo DiCaprio‚Äôs character is immoral, he‚Äôs bad, and yet you‚Äôre fascinated to see him. I would like to think Animal is a mix of Scorsese and Tarantino.‚Äù

FC Goa were determined not to make Mumbai‚Äôs title charge easy, trying to beat them with their own attacking method. They found success with this approach as early as in the fifth minute.
A long free kick found its way to Noah Sadaoui, who dodged past three defenders and found the target to put FC Goa ahead.

In the 40th minute, Diaz was found with a good low delivery from Lallianzuala Chhangte on the right and hooked the ball from the floor to put the Islanders in front.
Their joy was short-lived, as FC Goa caught them out with a long ball again. Sadaoui turned creator, finding Brandon Fernandes‚Äô run with a lob over the defence to put him one-on-one with Phurba Lachenpa. Fernandes made no mistake with his first touch and the hosts were level again.

"The smartphone might be going away into AI-driven, screen-less oblivion",Humane AI Pin gives us a direction on where the world of personal technology could be headed.,"The future of the smartphone might not be another smartphone, even if it bends or folds or can be wrapped around your wrist. The future of the smartphone will most probably be one in which the personal computing device that we have all held close to our hearts, quite literally, hides itself from plain sight. While top tech companies have been moving in this direction for years, the biggest step towards a post-smartphone world happened last week when Humane announced its AI Pin. The Humane AI Pin does everything a smartphone does, but actually does more, without being a smartphone that you hold in your hand, and presents a six-inch display for you to fiddle with.
The first time I got a hint about the smartphone taking the back seat was in 2015 when a conversation with a top tech company executive drifted towards how voice commands can tackle most of the smartphone functions. This was way before Alexa had become a thing and the closest we had to what we were speaking of was Siri.

Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI to unveil its first product tomorrow,"Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI to launch its first AI product on Saturday, claims it is better than OpenAI, Google and Anthropic in some aspects.","Elon Musk has announced with a post on X (formerly Twitter) that xAI will launch its first AI product to a select group of people on Saturday, claiming that it is ‚Äúthe best that currently exists‚Äù in some key aspects.
Founded in March, xAI seemingly is trying to go up against established players in the field, such as OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, which have developed some of the most advanced chatbots in the world, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude.
Musk, who is known for his ambitious and sometimes controversial ideas, has been vocal about his dissatisfaction with the current state of AI, especially its lack of alignment with human values and goals. In April, he revealed his plans for a new AI tool called ‚ÄúTruthGPT‚Äù, which he said would avoid the pitfalls of being ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù and instead focus on the objective reality.
Tomorrow, @xAI will release its first AI to a select group.
In some important respects, it is the best that currently exists.
‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 3, 2023

To achieve this goal, Musk has assembled a team of top AI researchers and engineers who have previously worked at companies like DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research, Twitter and Tesla. He has also acquired thousands of powerful GPU processors from Nvidia, the leading manufacturer of chips for AI applications, to build a large language model that can rival or surpass the existing ones.
According to Greg Yang, the co-founder of xAI, the company‚Äôs mission is to explore the ‚Äúmathematics of deep learning‚Äù, a branch of AI that uses large neural networks to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Yang said that xAI will ‚Äúdevelop the ‚Äòtheory of everything‚Äô for large neural networks‚Äù and take AI ‚Äúto the next level‚Äù.
Musk founded xAI in Nevada in March, according to official documents. He had previously renamed Twitter to ‚ÄúX Corp.‚Äù in some financial reports, but xAI‚Äôs website clarifies that it is a separate entity from X Corp., and that it will ‚Äúwork closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission‚Äù.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/elon-musk-xai-first-product-launch-saturday-announcement-9012222/,technology
Bihar launches ‚ÄòMission Daksh‚Äô for nearly 25 lakh academically weak school children,"During the regular inspection and monitoring by the DMs that started in July, it was found that there is a considerable number of academically weak students in almost all state-run schools, the letter said.","The Bihar government will launch a programme in December for nearly 25 lakh children lagging woefully behind their peers in schools with some of them incapable of reading simple Hindi words despite having reached upper primary classes, officials said on Thursday.
As part of the programme, ‚ÄòMission Daksh‚Äô, the state Education Department has directed teachers to intensively mentor such students, in batches of not more than five, with the ‚Äúwarning‚Äù that any laxity will cause them to face action.
Additional Chief Secretary of Education KK Pathak wrote to all the district magistrates (DMs) on November 21, requesting them to supervise the progress of the programme in their areas on a daily basis from December 1.
District-wise monitoring committees, headed by DMs, would be formed for the effective execution of ‚ÄòMission Daksh‚Äô, it said.

During the regular inspection and monitoring by the DMs that started in July, it was found that there is a considerable number of academically weak students in almost all state-run schools, the letter said.
‚ÄúKeeping this in mind, the department has decided to launch ‚ÄòMission Daksh‚Äô from December 1 in all government schools across the state to improve the academic performances of such students,‚Äù it said.
‚ÄúAcademically weak students are much behind their peers in schools‚Ä¶ some of them are incapable of reading simple Hindi words properly despite having reached upper primary classes,‚Äù it added.
Pathak directed that such students be identified on a priority basis.

‚ÄúAfter that, the principals will ask teachers to conduct extra classes (post-lunch) with not more than five children at a time. Such students often need individualised attention in order to fully grasp difficult concepts and bridge the learning gaps. This targeted approach will also allow teachers to personalise their teaching methods in a way that suits the unique needs of each weak student,‚Äù he said in the letter.
‚ÄúAll 25 lakh (approximately) such (academically weak) students will appear in their final examinations in April, 2024. If these students fail in their final examinations, strict departmental action will be initiated against their headmasters/ principals and teachers by the Education Department,‚Äù he said.
The Nitish Kumar government has been taking a slew of stringent measures to improve the quality of education in the state over the last one year.

Disney gambles on free cricket to turn the tables in India streaming war,The company will stream live matches of the Asia Cup from Aug. 30 as well as the World Cup in October-November that users of 600 million smartphones in the cricket-mad nation can watch without paying anything.,"Walt Disney is attempting to revive the fortunes of its streaming business in India by offering free cricket on smartphones, betting that the strategy will boost advertising revenue and offset the impact of a subscriber exodus.
The India streaming operations, which were Disney‚Äôs biggest last year globally by users, posted a loss of $41.5 million on revenue of $390 million for the year to March 2022, its last disclosed results.
With subscriber exits accelerating and slashing the user base by a third between October last year and July, the Burbank-headquartered entertainment giant‚Äôs financial performance in the country is only expected to come under more pressure.
ADVERTISEMENT
Disney‚Äôs woes are a cautionary tale about the Indian market where expectations about a swelling middle-class are often frustrated by deeply cost-conscious consumers.

The company acquired Indian streaming service Hotstar when it paid $71 billion for some 21st Century Fox global assets in 2019. With the streaming rights of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the world‚Äôs richest cricket league, in the bag, Disney made cricket on Hotstar a paid service in 2020 and was confident about garnering up to 100 million users within years.
But Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani snatched IPL rights away in a $2.9 billion bid last year, and then streamed games for free. Soon, Disney subscribers fled ‚Äì out of 61 million users in October, roughly 21 million had left by July.
Disney internally recognises it misjudged Indians‚Äô willingness to pay ‚Äì people signed up for Hotstar when it had IPL, but didn‚Äôt stick around to buy more premium plans to watch other content, two Disney sources told Reuters.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúWe were bullish on Indian subscribers‚Äô propensity to pay. That‚Äôs not worked out,‚Äù said one of the sources. ‚ÄúFree cricket is the only bullet left.‚Äù
The company will stream live matches of the Asia Cup from Aug. 30 as well as the World Cup in October-November that users of 600 million smartphones in the cricket-mad nation can watch without paying anything.
The new strategy comes as Disney is also exploring options of finding a joint venture partner or even a sale of its India business.

‚ÄòHYBRID MODEL‚Äô
Disney renewed its rights to show the International Cricket Council‚Äôs tournaments in India from 2024 to 2027 by paying around $3 billion. It retains digital streaming rights but last year licensed the TV broadcast rights to Indian‚Äôs Zee Entertainment for around $1.5 billion, a source said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The company has assessed that going back to the free-cricket model on mobile phones and tablets is the strategic pivot needed to shore up revenues. It calls the move a new ‚Äúhybrid model‚Äù to drive advertising revenues by raising smartphone viewers, while targeting new subscribers for the Hotstar TV app where cricket will remain under paid plans.
This strategy is about ‚Äúhow we build a model which will allow us to drive two revenue streams more meaningfully,‚Äù Sajith Sivanandan, head of Disney+ Hotstar, said in an interview, adding Disney was confident its user base will grow in the years ahead.
Making cricket free on mobile will help ‚Äú450 million-plus customers to tune in‚Äù over 48 days of the 50-over World Cup that is being hosted by India, compared to 300 million in the last World Cup in 2019, stated a ‚ÄúFestival of Cricket 2023‚Äù Disney presentation created for advertisers and seen by Reuters.
The company is eyeing a new record of 50 million concurrent viewership during the World Cup, double the 2019 number, the document added. That will also be 56% higher than what Ambani‚Äôs JioCinema clocked during this year‚Äôs IPL finals in May.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sivanandan said the company would target advertisers with budgets as low as 200,000 rupees ($2,421). Another new initiative would be interactive ads connecting watchers to a brand‚Äôs WhatsApp chat to enable purchases of the products.
The Disney document showed a new deal struck with Coca-Cola for boosting subscriptions. QR codes on an estimated 400 million Coke bottles will offer a Hotstar trial, with Disney hoping 80,000 people will then take paid plans.

LOW AVERAGE REVENUE
There is no guarantee, though, that Disney‚Äôs strategy pivot will succeed.
Daoud Jackson, a senior analyst specialising in streaming businesses at UK research firm Omdia, said free cricket was not a sure shot winner as companies pay billions of dollars to get streaming rights but commensurate advertising revenue takes many years to materialise.
ADVERTISEMENT
While India‚Äôs middle class is massive, the broad user base in the world‚Äôs most populous country ‚Äúnarrows sharply‚Äù when it comes to paying users, VC firm Blume Ventures said in April.
In the United States, ad-free Disney+ streaming service subscription rates are set to rise by 27% to $13.99 per month. By contrast in India, Disney+ Hotstar service costs $3.62 a month.
The average revenue per user (ARPU) is very low in India at just $0.59, compared to Disney+ U.S. service‚Äôs $7.31, according to Disney‚Äôs latest quarterly earnings report.
Disney‚Äôs global leadership has put pressure on India to speed up the ‚Äúpath to profitability‚Äù for Hotstar. CEO Bob Iger‚Äôs Chief of Staff, Nancy Lee, visited the country earlier this year and questioned the business leaders if streaming operations can be profitable before the end-2024 global target, sources said.
ADVERTISEMENT
She was told advancing of the target will not be possible.
Still, research firm Media Partners Asia estimated last year India‚Äôs streaming market will be worth $7 billion by 2027, where Netflix and Amazon.com‚Äôs Prime Video will also be competing. But it is the rivalry with JioCinema, run by Ambani‚Äôs broadcast unit Viacom18, that could be the most intense.
As Ambani promoted IPL on his streaming apps around March, he focused on how people can watch matches on the go on smartphones, and do not need a TV. To counter that, Disney at the time rolled out ads saying cricket was best watched on TV ‚Äì for which it still has IPL rights.
In new ad campaigns last week, Disney changed tack.
‚ÄúNow watch all matches of the world‚Äôs biggest tournaments, anywhere, on your mobile, absolutely free,‚Äù it said.

"India, US, 12 other IPEF members ink supply chain resilience agreement","India, the US and 12 other members of the IPEF grouping have signed a supply chain resilience agreement that would help mitigate risks of economic disruptions from supply chain shocks and improve crisis coordination. The agreement would help member countries like India to reduce their dependence on China and provide timely information to the IPEF [‚Ä¶]","India, the US and 12 other members of the IPEF grouping have signed a supply chain resilience agreement that would help mitigate risks of economic disruptions from supply chain shocks and improve crisis coordination.
The agreement would help member countries like India to reduce their dependence on China and provide timely information to the IPEF member countries about potential supply disruptions.
The COVID outbreak severely disrupted the global supply chain, as most countries were dependent on China for various products like pharma raw materials.
ADVERTISEMENT
The agreement was signed in San Francisco, where Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal is attending the ministerial meeting of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework For Prosperity (IPEF).
‚ÄúIndia joins the US and 12 other IPEF partners to ink the IPEF Supply Chain Resilience Agreement, a first-of-its-kind international agreement that will fortify and strengthen global supply chains; and foster adaptability, stability and sustainability,‚Äù Goyal said in a post on the social networking platform X on Wednesday.
Members of the bloc concluded the negotiations on this agreement, one of the four pillars of the IPEF, on May 27 this year in Detroit.
The pact will also seek to improve crisis coordination and response to supply chain disruptions and work together to support the timely delivery of affected goods during a crisis.
ADVERTISEMENT
Three new IPEF Supply Chain bodies could be set up to facilitate cooperation among the partners. The bodies will be ‚Äì the supply chain council; the supply chain crisis response network, and the IPEF Labor Rights Advisory Board.
The other benefits of the pact include supply chain diversification, mobilisation of investments, deeper integration of India in global value chains, support to MSMEs and creation of a seamless regional trade ecosystem, which would facilitate the flow of Indian products.
The agreement was signed by the minister, along with the ministers from other IPEF partner countries, the commerce ministry said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENT
Speaking at the event, Goyal emphasised enhancing collaboration to realise the collective aims of the IPEF, particularly on the need for mobilising affordable financing for a clean economy transition and for enhancing technology cooperation.
Further, the ministers from IPEF partner countries also had productive discussions on the ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù progress made in clean and fair economy pillars.
IPEF was launched jointly by the US and other partner countries of the Indo-Pacific region on May 23 last year in Tokyo.
The framework is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues like tax and anti-corruption). India has joined all the pillars except the trade one.
The members are expected to announce the conclusion of talks for the clean economy and fair economy pillars during this week.
ADVERTISEMENT
Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam are members of the bloc.
It would come into force after the implementation of the agreement by any of the five member countries.
ADVERTISEMENT
According to an official, the commerce ministry is expected to hold an outreach programme pan India for domestic industry, explaining the benefits of the agreement and how to utilise that.
Under the agreement, IPEF partners seek to provide a framework to build their collective understanding of significant supply chain risks; improve crisis coordination and response to supply chain disruptions; facilitate cooperation, mobilise investments, and promote regulatory transparency in sectors and goods critical to national security and public health and safety.
ADVERTISEMENT
The critical sectors will be identified by the member countries.
To implement and monitor the agreement, the bloc would set up the IPEF Supply Chain Council.
The council will meet every year, and all the members will have to report on the progress of the implementation of the agreement.
The crisis response network would deal with emergency issues, help partners seek support during a supply chain disruption and facilitate information sharing and collaboration among IPEF partners during a crisis, enabling a faster and more effective response that minimises negative effects on their economies.
On the other hand, the advisory board would help members in promoting labour rights in their supply chains.
Later in the day, when asked about labour issues in this agreement, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said it is basically the harmonisation of regulations on the subject.
‚ÄúIn this, we have agreed that labour is an important element wherever global value chains (GVCs) operate, and if investments have to come, labour regime is very important.
‚ÄúBut, what we have agreed is that it will be applicable as per the domestic labour laws. So, it is nothing beyond the domestic labour laws,‚Äù he told reporters here.
He said that it is basically a cooperative mechanism. So, there is no dispute settlement system.
If an investor from IPEF member countries feels that there is some inconsistency, then it will be bilaterally resolved under a cooperation framework, the secretary said.
‚ÄúSo, that is how things will be resolved. It is basically to strengthen the GVCs within the Asia Pacific,‚Äù he said, adding that for India to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), it is important that these value chains operate around a certain kind of regulatory regime.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/india-us-12-other-ipef-members-ink-supply-chain-resilience-agreement-9028191/,business

Jannik Sinner‚Äôs strong and improved baseline game helps him stun Novak Djokovic to reach Australian Open final,"Baseline strategy has been central to Jannik Sinner's game and he has been working on it with his new coaching team since the start of 2022 ‚Äì led by Darren Cahill, Andre Agassi‚Äôs former coach.","In a resolute, nerveless, three-hour-long display of destructive shot making and tactical mastery, Jannik Sinner, the rising 22-year-old World No.4, defeated Novak Djokovic 6-1, 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-3 in the semifinals of the Australian Open on Friday, reaching his first Major final and becoming the first Italian man to reach the singles final in Melbourne.
Sinner outplayed and outmanoeuvred the undisputed king of Melbourne Park ‚Äì and men‚Äôs tennis in general ‚Äì and in doing so, not only strengthened his long-held credentials as a potential great in the making, but also achieved a feat that none of the Serb‚Äôs greatest rivals had been able to accomplish even at the peak of their careers.
Prior to Friday, 10-time champion Djokovic had never lost in the semifinal or final of the Australian Open. A perfect 20-0 record. He was 33 matches unbeaten in Melbourne, a streak that went back to 2018 ‚Äì 2195 days, as the broadcasters were keen to point out every chance they got.
Savour the moment @janniksin ü•ï#AusOpen ‚Ä¢ #AO2024 pic.twitter.com/FTSDsa2AOp
‚Äî #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 26, 2024
The Serb‚Äôs dominance of the Slams, and particularly Melbourne Park, was not simply down to extraordinary tennis repertoire, but instead part of a legacy built on a near-supernatural ability to expose best-of-five tennis for the collection of short sprints that it is, as opposed to the consistent long run marathon it has always been claimed to be.
Even when thoroughly outplayed, Djokovic has always possessed the athleticism and presence of mind to take matches deep, win the pressure points, keep himself competitive enough to give himself a chance to win the match in the finer margins.
So, Sinner‚Äôs statement-making victory was not completed during the first half of the match, when the solid Italian took advantage of a streaky-looking Djokovic to race into an early two-set lead. Instead, it was earned during the second half, when he prevented the 24-time Grand Slam champion, who raised his game to try to take the contest deep, from completing one of his signature comebacks.
Superior in all departments
Djokovic was unquestionably flat at the start of this match, and his second-half recovery was never too convincing either, similar to his level in his first five matches of the tournament. Out of 90 completed points in the first two sets, Djokovic made 29 unforced errors.
He would admit to this himself, cutting a disappointed figure in his post-match press conference. ‚ÄúI was, in a way, shocked with my level, in a bad way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis is one of the worst Grand Slam matches I‚Äôve ever played, at least that I remember‚Ä¶ This tournament hasn‚Äôt been, as I said, up to my standard or criteria or the level that I would normally play or expect myself to play‚Äù
And Sinner was in diametrically opposite form.
Scintillating Sinner üáÆüáπüî•

Baseline strategy has formed a primary emphasis of the work he has been doing with his new coaching team ‚Äì led by Darren Cahill, Andre Agassi‚Äôs former coach ‚Äì since the start of 2022 and he nailed it in the biggest result of his career. The Italian‚Äôs lean, wiry frame and composed demeanour do not betray the full strength of the destructive power that comes off his racquet.
His pure ball striking ability would send Djokovic trailing to catch balls, and his aggression from start to finish allowed him to finish points before Djokovic could even get balls back into play to wear him down. Djokovic was out of sorts, but it was Sinner‚Äôs baseline prowess that had him totally out of his comfort zone, making him rush his shots and extracting errors.
Despite it not being the highlight of his game, Sinner served exceptionally ‚Äì according to Opta, this is the first Grand Slam match of Djokovic‚Äôs 19-year-long career where he did not even have a single break point opportunity.
ADVERTISEMENT
Sinner won 80 of the points when the rallies were four shots or less, as opposed to Djokovic‚Äôs 43. In the first two sets, that number is 32-16, showing just how well Sinner was serving and returning, and keeping points short to keep Djokovic out of his comfort zone.
Maintaining composure
Djokovic was subpar throughout the match, but recovered from the first two sets reasonably, he began to raise his level just enough to make sure he can take advantage if the player on the other side of the net buckled.
Lesser players would have tightened up one set away from the biggest result of their career, but Sinner‚Äôs concentration never wavered. Even as Djokovic improved, the Italian stayed true to his aggressive strategy, and served consistently well to get over the line in the pressure moments and take the third set into a tiebreaker, where Djokovic typically showed signs of life and recovered from match point down ‚Äì with an expertly executed lob no less ‚Äì to edge the tiebreaker. Another famous turnaround was lurking.

But Sinner never cowered, coming out in the fourth set just as he had done all match ‚Äì bombing down serves, putting pressure on Djokovic through aggressive return strategy, and striking the ball as purely as he had done from the start.
It would be Djokovic who would blink. After saving two break points earlier in the set, his serve would be broken on a game in which he was 40-0 up. Anyone familiar with Djokovic‚Äôs history would be aware that the match is far from over, but Sinner served out the win with the freedom of a player that was not simply attempting to protect his lead, but outrightly going for the kill.
Ever since he was a teenager, hype has swirled around the lethal nature of his shotmaking and complete nature of his game. After growing into his body and peaking physically, Sinner‚Äôs tendency to collapse meant he needed to prove that he could hold his nerve against an all-time great opponent with the Grand Slam pressure on him. After picking up his third win in four matches against Djokovic, and reaching his first Major final, some of those doubts have surely been put to bed.",https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/jannik-sinners-strong-and-improved-baseline-game-helps-him-stun-novak-djokovic-to-reach-australian-open-final-9129073/,sports
Ancelotti says abuse of Vinicius Jr is problem for all Spanish football,"Vinicius received racist abuse from fans in Mallorca on Sunday during an ill-tempered match in which the Brazilian was fouled 10 times, the most for any player in LaLiga this season.","Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Tuesday that the abuse that has been directed at his player Vinicius Jr is a problem for the whole of Spanish football, not for the 22-year-old Brazilian.
Vinicius received racist abuse from fans in Mallorca on Sunday during an ill-tempered match in which the Brazilian was fouled 10 times, the most for any player in LaLiga this season.
Vinicius has been subjected to racial abuse by fans on at least three other occasions and is the most fouled player in Europe‚Äôs top seven leagues by a big margin.
‚ÄúIt seems that the problem is Vinicius, and it is not like that. It is a problem of Spanish football and it must be solved,‚Äù Ancelotti told a news conference in Rabat on Tuesday, on the eve of Real Madrid‚Äôs Club World Cup semi-final against Egypt‚Äôs Al Ahly.
‚ÄúThe question I ask is this: Is it Vinicius or his team mates? What do his team mates have to defend Vinicius from? Vinicius is the victim of something that I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù
Supporters in Mallorca could be heard racially insulting the player in a video published by streaming company DAZN on social media on Sunday.
Spanish police are also investigating a possible hate crime against the Brazilian after a mannequin wearing his No. 20 shirt was hung from a bridge in front of the club‚Äôs training centre ahead of the Madrid derby two weeks ago.
ADVERTISEMENT
The mannequin was hung by the neck next to a banner in Atletico Madrid‚Äôs red and white colours that read ‚ÄúMadrid hates Real‚Äù during the early hours of Jan. 26, police said.
In September, prosecutors in Madrid decided not to press charges over racist chanting aimed at Vinicius after finding it had ‚Äúlasted a few seconds‚Äù and had not constituted a crime.
Pele, Neymar and other leading Brazilian figures defended Vinicius in September after a panelist on a Spanish soccer show compared his goal celebrations to that of a monkey, sparking an immediate backlash on social media.
Vinicius issued a video statement at the time in response to what he called a ‚Äúxenophobic and racist‚Äù insult, saying he ‚Äúwon‚Äôt stop dancing‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe happiness of a black Brazilian being successful in Europe bothers‚Äù many people.
ADVERTISEMENT
In December, the player accused LaLiga of continuing to do nothing about racist fans at matches, after videos on social media showed some shouting abuse and throwing objects at him during a match the previous day in Valladolid.
‚ÄúOn the issue of racism, I think that is people that are bitter with their own lives who go in the stands and try to pay for their frustrations with a 22-year-old kid. You have to have respect for other people,‚Äù Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde told a news conference on Tuesday.

San Francisco moves to center of robotaxi universe after California agency vote,Cruise and Waymo have been running experimental services limited by times and geographic areas within San Francisco.,"California just supercharged the self-driving car industry.
Following a contentious state agency vote, Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Waymo and General Motors‚Äô Cruise are allowed to take paying passengers day or night throughout San Francisco, solidifying the tech hub as the center of the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry. It marks a significant step forward for the nascent technology.
The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday sided with the companies in the face of vigorous opposition from some residents and city agencies. Commissioners heard more than six hours of public comment from residents and special interest groups supporting or opposing the measure that would expand paid autonomous vehicle service.

Transportation and safety agencies, such as the police and fire departments, as well as many residents had opposed expanding paid robotaxi service because of what they said were concerns about erratic driving and interference with their operations. The agencies, which have no regulatory authority, lobbied forcefully for a more measured rollout of the experimental vehicles.
In favor of the expansion were technologists and residents who said they felt the cars offer a safer alternative to human drivers and are a critical boost to San Francisco‚Äôs economy.
The companies now have permission to begin citywide paid taxi service at all hours of the day and have said they plan to deploy more cars as a result. They collectively have more than 500 autonomous vehicles already in operation.
Before approving the expansion, Commissioner John Reynolds addressed some of the public‚Äôs concerns. ‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt yet have the data to judge AVs against the standard that humans are setting, I do believe in the potential of this technology to increase safety on the roadway.‚Äù

Cruise and Waymo have been running experimental services limited by times and geographic areas within San Francisco. Neither indicated on Thursday how soon they may move to make round-the-clock taxi service a reality, but they promised to do so soon in promotional emails after the vote.
The move is a critical step forward in regulating the robot cars, which Waymo, Cruise and others have been systematically rolling out in cities and states around the nation.
The approval ‚Äúmarks the true beginning of our commercial operations in San Francisco,‚Äù said Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo co-CEO, in a prepared statement. It puts ‚ÄúCruise in a position to compete with traditional ridehail, and challenge an unsafe, inaccessible transportation status quo,‚Äù said Prashanthi Raman, Cruise vice president of global government affairs, in an emailed statement.
San Francisco is important as both a symbolic hub of tech and, with hundreds of AVs already in operation, the largest test lab for the experimental cars. The companies have said real-world testing in dense city environments is essential to perfecting the technology.

Waymo will be permitted to drive at speeds of up to 65 miles per hour and in inclement weather, while Cruise will be limited to 35 miles per hour and will not be allowed to drive when weather does not permit, the commission said Thursday.
The companies, who applied with the commission for permits to expand taxi service, have said their vehicles are safer than distractible human drivers and have yet to cause a life-threatening injury or death.
Cruise and Waymo will now also operate in direct competition with local companies Uber and Lyft in offering rides summoned by app.
The vehicles, with empty driver seats and self-turning steering wheels, have become a common sight around San Francisco. Locals frequently document their driving hiccups on social media.

The robotaxi proposal had divided San Francisco between locals who resent their city being used as to test what they say is an unproven technology and those who say they feel the symbolic technology capital ought to be the leader in developing what could lead to fewer traffic accidents and injuries.
Hundreds of residents and members of various interest groups filed in to the commission‚Äôs San Francisco hearing room to comment in one-minute increments on either side of the issue, citing issues ranging from accessibility for the disabled, safety, software coding, union activity and conflicts of interest, among a host of other concerns.
The commission had heard testimony from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency that it had logged close to 600 incidents involving autonomous vehicles since spring of 2022 which they believe is ‚Äúa fraction‚Äù of the total due to what they said are lax reporting requirements.
Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma advocated for a delayed vote noting the volume of public comment and her lingering concerns following evidence that the vehicles have obstructed emergency vehicles in San Francisco. She was the lone ‚Äúno‚Äù vote.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúAll it takes is one real life example of a driverless autonomous vehicle that prevents a first responder from doing its job in real time that convinces me that we should not approve citywide deployment,‚Äù she said.
Technologists and other residents who supported the broader rollout of autonomous vehicles said they feared that a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote could derail a local industry that brings jobs and attention to a city in desperate need of a financial lift.",https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/san-francisco-moves-to-center-of-robotaxi-universe-after-california-agency-vote-8890321/,technology
"India‚Äôs Russian crude imports prevented price surge, ‚Äòhavoc‚Äô in global oil market, says petroleum ministry",India is the world‚Äôs third-largest consumer of crude oil and depends on imports to meet over 85 per cent of its requirement.,"Global crude oil prices would have surged and created ‚Äúhavoc‚Äù in the international oil market had India not ramped up oil imports from Russia in the aftermath of Moscow‚Äôs February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the petroleum and natural gas ministry told the department-related parliamentary standing committee.
‚ÄúIf they (Indian refiners) had not imported Russian oil into India, which may be a big number of 1.95 million barrels per day, that deficiency would have created a havoc in the crude oil market and the prices would have shot up by about $30-40,‚Äù a petroleum ministry representative was quoted as saying in a recent report of the standing committee on petroleum and natural gas. The report was tabled in Parliament on December 20.

Sri Lankan government renews Lanka IOC‚Äôs petroleum licence for 20 years,"The licence originally issued in 2003 was to expire in January 2024. This will allow Lanka IOC to continue its retail operations on the debt-trapped island nation until January 22, 2044.","The Sri Lankan government has renewed the petroleum products licence granted to Lanka IOC, the local subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation, for another 20 years, officials said on Monday.
The licence originally issued in 2003 was to expire in January 2024. This will allow Lanka IOC to continue its retail operations on the debt-trapped island nation until January 22, 2044.
The licence renewal letter was handed over by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to Dipak Das the Managing Director of LIOC late last week, Aseem Bhargav, the Chief Financial Officer of LIOC said in a statement.

The government has renewed the petroleum products licence granted to Lanka IOC, the local subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation, for another 20 years, the LIOC officials told PTI on Monday.
‚ÄúThe licence enables LIOC to import, export, store, transport, distribute, sell and supply petrol diesel, heavy diesel, furnace oil, kerosene, Naphtha and other mineral petroleum including premium petrol and premium diesel.‚Äù The LIOC holds around 20 per cent of the market share in the auto fuel segment in Sri Lanka.
When Sri Lanka plunged into an economic crisis with no forex to import petroleum products, the LIOC operation became crucial in the energy sector. It operates over 200 retail outlets throughout the island nation.
Since the economic crisis came to bite Sri Lanka, it liberalised the energy sector. China‚Äôs Sinopec entered in August as the third player in the retail fuel trade while USA‚Äôs RM Parks and Australia‚Äôs United Petroleum are also due to commence operations soon.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, the main opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) on Sunday expressed its strong opposition to the Government‚Äôs decision to extend Lanka IOC‚Äôs petroleum licence.
Speaking at a press conference held at the opposition leader‚Äôs office in Colombo, SJB Deputy General Secretary Mujibur Rahman raised questions regarding the basis on which the licence renewal was granted by the Government.
Rahman pointed out that the agreement with Lanka IOC was originally established in 2001, granting the entity hefty tax concessions and a 20-year licence to operate in Sri Lanka in exchange for a USD 70 million investment.
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThe agreement was struck without a competitive tender process and lacked transparency,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by the Daily Financial Times newspaper.
‚ÄúOnce again, there was no competitive tender process or transparency. Are we obligated to grant this deal to the IOC? Was this agreement secretly negotiated between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Narendra Modi?‚Äù he asked.
Rahman pointed out that IOC was unable to address the fuel shortages during Sri Lanka‚Äôs most severe crisis or provide better prices to the public.",https://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/sri-lankan-government-renews-lanka-ioc-petroleum-licence-20-years-9005840/,business

Rebel Moon movie review: Zack Snyder‚Äôs spectacularly dull sci-fi epic is the worst film of his career,"Rebel Moon movie review: Despite echoes of Lagaan and India's colonial past, director Zack Snyder's legions of local fans might struggle to find positives about his ghastly new Netflix film.","Whatever the tonnage of the cash-laden trucks that Netflix presumably backed into Anthony Hopkins‚Äô garage before parachuting him in to save the indefensibly dull Rebel Moon at the last moment, it wasn‚Äôt enough.
